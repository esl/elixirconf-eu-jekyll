Bartosz is a programmer from Kraków, Poland. Dealing with multimedia and streaming for last couple of years, he spent hours watching Big Buck Bunny frame-by-frame and deciphering various three- and four-letter abbreviations by reading RFCs. Making use of his multimedia experience, he became one of the Lead Architects of Membrane and big Elixir enthusiast. Always happy to learn something new, whether that's a technology or trivia.
