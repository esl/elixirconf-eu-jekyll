I have 5+ years of commercial experience, including 4 years as a Software Engineer at Software Mansion in Kraków, Poland. Currently contracting for a large U.S.-based company, working primarily with Elixir. On a day-to-day basis, we work with an architecture handling tens of thousands of active users at a time, leveraging the strengths of BEAM, Phoenix, Ecto, and Oban. We're actively incorporating AI into our workflows. Read more about my experience on my blog: dimamik.com/about.
