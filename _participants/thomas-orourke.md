Thomas’ greatest strengths are enthusiasm and mentoring. He keeps himself busy making sense of software stacks/organisations and driving products to market. Having worked with a variety of computer languages, systems and fields for three decades gives some perspective. He has been using Elixir for several years now and is an avid supporter and evangelist for the language, organising meet-ups, blogging and committing when he can. 

“Take it apart until you understand how it works,” is his motto – he’s currently busy putting lots of things back together.
