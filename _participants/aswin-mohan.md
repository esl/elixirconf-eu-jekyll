Aswin started coding at 14, made his first bootable Operating System at 16. He really loves the freedom that Open Source brings to our life (not the freedom about privacy, but the freedom to modify and customise our software to our liking down to the source). Aswin loves giving back to the software and the supporting community that he uses either in code contributions, testing out features or hanging around in the issue tracker.
