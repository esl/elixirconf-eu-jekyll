Simon is the Co-founder and CTO for Turn.io. Simon is excited about technology, especially when it is applied to improve the lives of less privileged people. Growing up in the Middle East ruined him for the ordinary as those years left an unmistakable impression and set him on a direct course to be involved in community development, entrepreneurship and technology. Prior to Turn.io, Simon was the Chief Engineer for Praekelt.org, helping lead the launch of the world's first nationally integrated mobile pregnancy registry for the South African Department of Health and subsequently launching the world's first national health platform on the WhatsApp Business API.
