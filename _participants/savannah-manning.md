Savannah is a Software Engineer, experienced with Elixir & JavaScript technologies. With 6+ years of experience in an entrepreneurial setting, a career spanning from international logistics planning to web development, problem-solving has been at the forefront of her work. After graduating from University in 2017, she started her own award-winning rock-climbing company geared towards empowering women & providing them with the skills to become self-sufficient climbers. During this time, she was an advocate & public speaker in the climbing community represented as a The North Face athlete & spoke in front of groups like Girl Scouts of America. At the beginning of the pandemic, she began her journey in software engineering as a self-taught developer. Her creative problem-solving, technical thought process, & determined nature have given her success in her role as an SE. Beyond her endless excitement for learning, you can find her outside, most likely, climbing on a cliffside!
