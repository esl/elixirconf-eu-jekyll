Jakub spent 4 years as a UNICEF Innovation Officer in South East Asia, working where social impact meets tech. Around the same time, he fell in love with Elixir/BEAM and got blown away by its capabilities. Working on social challenges by day and coding Elixir by night, he found the perfect spot where these worlds could collide.

A software engineer and philosopher by education (yes, that's a thing!), his journey zigzagged through PM roles at UNICEF, Microsoft's R&D, Fintech startup, and finally landed him in Elixir development. He enjoys both dreaming up solutions and getting his hands dirty with code.
