Daniel Caixinha is a software engineer, currently working at <a href="https://www.getsona.com">Sona</a>, where he is using Elixir and Phoenix LiveView to build great products that can also handle the high growth of the business.

After graduating from Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, he joined the startup world, mainly using Ruby, but he also got the chance to play around with Elixir, which made him fall in love with functional programming in general, and Elixir in particular.

Besides building Elixir applications, he is fostering the use of Elixir, being a co-organiser of the Lisbon Elixir meetup.
