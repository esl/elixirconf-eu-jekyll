With humble Ruby beginnings, it's no surprise Sheharyar fell in love with Elixir the very first time he used it. Now with over 5 years working with Elixir, and over 11 in the software industry, he has open-sourced many popular tools & libraries in Elixir and other languages, and actively writes and speaks about Elixir every chance he gets.

Currently working at Slab as a backend engineer, Sheharyar is helping build and grow their real-time collaborative document editor. In his free time, you can find him answering questions on StackOverflow, reading about distributed systems, evangelizing Elixir, and running the Google Developers Group in Pakistan as a means to empower the emerging developer community there.
