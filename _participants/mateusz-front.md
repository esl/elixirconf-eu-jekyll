Mateusz develops various Elixir and multimedia applications and libraries at Software Mansion. He read lots of RFCs and thus he knows many three-letter abbreviations. He learned to like debugging (to some extent at least). He enjoys mountains, music and a cup of good tea. He is a co-creator of Membrane.
