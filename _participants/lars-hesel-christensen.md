Lars has worked with a large range of technologies in lots of different business domains. He started out working with embedded systems written in C, moved on to building award winning mobile banking apps and eventually discovered the Erlang and the Beam VM where he's stayed since. For almost a decade he has worked on large scale distributed messaging systems (MQTT) such as VerneMQ.  
Somewhere along the way Elixir came along and is now his technology of choice.  
Currently Lars is working as a Solution Architect at Helvetia Insurance Switzerland where he's building self-service integration solutions in Elixir.
