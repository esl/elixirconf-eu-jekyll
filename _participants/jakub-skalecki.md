A seasoned developer with over 12 years of experience across Python, JavaScript, and Elixir. Jakub has worn many hats - from team leader to entrepreneur. Currently, he is building Postline.ai, an AI-powered platform that heavily utilizes LiveView and LiveVue.

As the creator of LiveVue and maintainer of the Readability library, Jakub is passionate about bringing the best practices from various technologies into the Elixir ecosystem. His journey through different technologies and startups has taught them the importance of choosing the right tool for the job - and sometimes that means building the tool yourself.
