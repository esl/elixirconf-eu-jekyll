Bernardo got his first contact with programming at about 12 years old by “reverse-engineering” some JS code on a page to transform into a dice roller for DnD sessions with his brother. Starting his professional career with Ruby he ended up getting to know about Elixir at a RubyConf Brasil from a José Valim talk. That knowledge came in handy when he was implementing a banking system from scratch and managed to convince people to use Elixir for most parts of the system at Stone. Now, he is a Software Engineer at Slab.
