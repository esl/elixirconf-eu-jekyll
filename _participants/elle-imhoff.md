Elle is a software archaeologist and entomologist: she studies old code and finds bugs. She started working on IntelliJ Elixir in 2014 after hearing Dave Thomas give a talk about Elixir at Lone Star Ruby in 2014. In addition to IntelliJ Elixir, she's made contributions to Elixir itself and has personally been told she can use unsupported APIs by Jos√© Valim.
