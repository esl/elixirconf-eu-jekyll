De Wet Blomerus (sounds like "The Vet") is married to his best friend, Marysol. They live in Atlanta and together they are raising our three young kids. De Wet is an audiobook devourer, and burger connoisseur, he can ride a wheelie on his bicycle, and he built their kitchen cabinets himself.  
Elixir gives De Wet a drive and excitement about programming that he has not felt for other technologies in a long time.
