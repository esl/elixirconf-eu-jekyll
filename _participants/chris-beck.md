Chris began his career by attempting to code a text editor in assembly on a C64. After that — somewhat surprisingly — failed, he took a break from computers and founded Bitcrowd much later, in 2010.

Since 2016, Bitcrowd has primarily focused on Elixir projects. Their open-source Elixir projects include Carbonite (https://github.com/bitcrowd/carbonite), Chromic PDF (https://github.com/bitcrowd/chromic_pdf), and RAG.ex (https://hex.pm/packages/rag). They also run Exmeralda (https://exmeralda.chat/), a chatbot for Hex packages. They are one of Europe’s go-to Elixir & AI consultancies.

Since the rise of AI, Chris and his team have been researching the opportunities, dangers, and influences of AI. bitcrowd, his Elixir consultancy, has built countless ML projects since 2020.
