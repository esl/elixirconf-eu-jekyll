Chris founded bitcrowd in 2010 as a rails company, since 2016, bitcrowd mainly works with elixir projects. Their open source elixir projects include https://github.com/bitcrowd/carbonite and https://github.com/bitcrowd/chromic_pdf. 

When ChatGPT had its first coding interview with Chris, he was fascinated to encounter a new form of thinking and coding, reminiscent of his fascination with BASIC on his first computer at the age of 12.

Since then, he has been researching the opportunities, dangers, and influence of AI. bitcrowd, his Elixir consultancy, has built various ML projects since 2021.
