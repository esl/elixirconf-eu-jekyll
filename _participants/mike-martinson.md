As a polyglot developer and functional programming enthusiast, Mike has been pitching Elixir to his friends and colleagues since 2015. Since then, he’s led multiple Elixir projects building and running real-time applications for startups. When he’s not in front of a text editor hacking on products, you can find him in the mountains in Western Canada, tearing downhill on a bike or skis.
