Victor is currently a technical leader of the Stone OpenBanking solution and a BEAM admirer since OTP 13 (before Elixir). Author of some widely used Elixir libraries like Joken, Joken JWKS and JUnit Formatter he is also passionate about Emacs and is one of the maintainers of elixir-mode. With a Philosophy major he usually attracts political and ethical discussions which is a curse and a pleasure at the same time. Other than family, music, skating, dogs, philosophy, programming and beer hunting he does nothing at all.
