Davide Bettio is a long-time open source enthusiast who fell in love with Elixir while building the Astarte IoT platform at Ispirata (now SECO Mind). An embedded systems devotee since high school, he also contributed early on to KDE. In 2017, he created AtomVM to run Elixir and Erlang on tiny microcontrollers with only a few kilobytes of RAM. Today, as Head of Technology at SECO Mind, he leads advanced IoT solutions but devotes his free time to tinkering with code. When heâ€™s not coding, Davide enjoys hiking in the Alps.
