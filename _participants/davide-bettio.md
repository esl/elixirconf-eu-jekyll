Davide Bettio is a long-time open source enthusiast. Passionate about embedded systems since high school, he also contributed early on to KDE. In 2017, he created AtomVM to run Elixir and Erlang on tiny microcontrollers with only a few kilobytes of RAM. Today, he is working full-time on AtomVM. When he’s not coding, Davide enjoys hiking in the Alps.
