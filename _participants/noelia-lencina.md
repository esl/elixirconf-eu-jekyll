I am a Senior Software Engineer who started her career learning Ruby and Elixir at the same time back in 2017 and fell in love with both languages. After a couple years working with both, and a few more focused on Ruby, I decided to go exclusive with Elixir 4 years ago and haven't looked back. I am passionate about sharing what I know and learning from others wherever I go, and strongly believe communities are the base for all technology.
