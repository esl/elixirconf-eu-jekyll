When Barnabas started to work, he was doing an apprenticeship as an electrician. After finishing that and looking for something new, he started working as a Service Technician at LTW, where he could combine Travel with Work. After a couple of years of doing that, Barnabas could switch departments inside the company. There he was programming Siemens PLCs to run the Stacker Cranes. He then started to get his A-Levels and earned his BSc in Software Engineering at the University of Applied Sciences Vorarlberg. Barnabas started working as a Software Engineer on the side in the third semester and have mostly worked in Web Technologies since then.
