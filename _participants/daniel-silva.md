Daniel started programming at the age of 10 when his brother first showed him how to make simple programs with BASIC. After that the fuse was lit and quickly his curiosity led him to Visual Basic and C, and later on with an internet connection, HTML/CSS and Javascript to make simple websites. At college, he studied computer science and networking. Working professionally with Elixir since 2017, Daniel is currently helping Coverflex creating the next-generation flexible benefits platform for companies and employees - the bank of the employee.
