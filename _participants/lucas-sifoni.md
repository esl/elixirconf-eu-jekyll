Indie developer since 2015, building design+data automation systems in the field of architecture, to free my clients from otherwise tedious, error-prone, and repetitive but business-critical workflows. Aside from that, I'm experimenting in the field of optics and astronomy, and strive to put Elixir in my hobby projects too.
