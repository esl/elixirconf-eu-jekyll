Eli has been a functional programming zealot since 2017, when he discovered the joys of Elm and Elixir. An avid technologist, Eli likes to poke and prod all sorts of different technologies to see how they work - and to share the results of his experiments with anyone who'll listen. In addition to his professional work designing distributed High Performance Computing (HPC), Eli tries to blend all of his passions for technology, arts, crafts, and accessibility in his personal projects.
