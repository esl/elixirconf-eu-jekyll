After a number of years working for the UK Government in various roles (project manager, requirements analyst, commercial advisor, etc) Tim switched careers to be a software engineer and have never looked back. He has mainly worked as a backend/data engineer with Scala but switched to being a full-stack engineer with Elixir more recently and has been loving it.
