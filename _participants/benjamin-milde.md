Not the classic programmer career. Started learning programming while still in school to build websites. Studied media design instead of IT to not need to deal with low level hardware/software. When Websites grew into larger services, I eventually found Elixir and haven't looked back since. For the last two years I've been consulting on a Nerves-based system, so hardware still got me.
