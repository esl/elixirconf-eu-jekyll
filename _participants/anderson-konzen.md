Software Engineer with experience in both design and programming, Anderson has already worked on several areas - from building websites to automotive systems, embedded systems to desktop and mobile applications.

On the tech side, he has been working with Elixir and its ecosystem for some years now. Anderson discovered the language and the functional paradigm some years ago, and it just clicked. He co-hosted the Elixir Meetup group in Porto Alegre for a few years with friends, with the idea of promoting the technology and learning from the community.
