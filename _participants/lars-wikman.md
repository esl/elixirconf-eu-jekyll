From self-taught web dev, through many roles and currently running a small consultancy, it has always been a journey of curiosity. Fundamentally driven by cool concepts and projects. Lars runs the Underjord.io blog, newsletter and YouTube to share and spread his curiosity about the Elixir and the BEAM along with a few other computery topics. In community collaborations you'll find him on BEAM Radio and creating the Nerves project Newsletter as well as working with companies to help them find the great Elixir developers that are out there. Originally from the north of Sweden, he and his family live in a small rural town along Sweden's west coast, near Varberg.
