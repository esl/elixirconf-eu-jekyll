Laura became fascinated with Erlang during her studies in Software Engineering and has been an advocate of our beloved technology ever since. Nowadays, this means she introduces the BEAM to the next generations of CS graduates, preaches it to local developer groups and FP-related events, introduces it in new projects with local companies, and exploits it as a research tool in collaboration with colleagues all around the world.
