Mat is an ever-restless polymath from Toronto who loves solving the really gnarly problems. A perennial builder whose natural habitat is the basement workbench, heâ€™s a fan of honesty, good design, and golden era hip-hop. He's been spending the last few years building out the Bandit web server and various supporting libraries, and will happily talk your ear off about anything networking related. He / Him.
