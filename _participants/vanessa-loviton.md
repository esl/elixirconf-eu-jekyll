Vanessa Loviton lives in Paris, where she works as a backend engineer at Andjaro. Having started with Ruby (on it's rails), she quickly jumped to Elixir and never looked back. When sheâ€™s not busy implementing new features, she spends way too much time on video games or around role-play tables with her friends.
