Karoline is a full-stack software engineer at Multiverse, building an outstanding alternative to university and corporate training. After working as a civil engineer for 5 years and using Python for data analysis, in early 2022 she decided to take a leap into the world of software development, and hasn't looked back since.  
  
She has used Elixir, Phoenix and LiveView for just over a year, and is constantly looking for ways to expand her knowledge and learn new tech. On a day-to-day basis she is building the Multiverse Platform, enabling candidates to research, apply, and get hired for world-class tech apprenticeships. She is passionate about improving diversity and equality of opportunity in the tech sector.  
  
Karoline is from Norway but is currently based in London. She enjoys the outdoors and will (hopefully) be running the London marathon 2 days after ElixirConf EU!
