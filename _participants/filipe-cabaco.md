10+ years of experience total but in love with Elixir for the last 7 years were I've built multiple projects.

Currently working at Supabase building multiple projects with Elixir but also releasing some opensource libraries with ex_tauri, openapi_generator and Francis.

Eager to learn more and happy to share about anything Elixir related!
