I learn from young learners of new ways to make math alive. Big believer in the ways of Seymour Papert, Alan Kay and Joe Armstrong of forcing the computer to understand your understanding, by creating a recursive world of understanding where you're not quite sure if you're teaching the machine or if the machine is teaching you.
