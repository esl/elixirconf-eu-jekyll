Leading award-winning business software development at Or Equals, specializing in Phoenix Live View and Elixir. Public company investor. Keynote Speaker. Software Developer. Semi-Pro Poker player.  
  
I have over 8 years of experience in the software development industry and have a proven track record of delivering quality software solutions to our clients. I took that experience and started a custom business software consultancy.  
  
A few of the businesses weâ€™ve helped:  
* We helped a local organic grocery delivery service, think Instacart, but for the Jacksonville, Florida area. Our new system connected this local business to new customers. It increased their sign-up throughput by 50%!  
* Another Client was a homeless shelter in downtown Jacksonville. We build them a bespoke inventory management to help them distribute groceries, clothing and emergency financial assistance.
