I’ve been building software for nearly two decades, from Ruby to iOS and now Elixir. I’m an experiment-driven builder who loves shipping practical solutions to real problems. Over the past six years, I’ve focused on entrepreneurship, and today I’m the founder and CTO of a vehicle meta-search startup.
