Gabriel is a full-stack software engineer at Pass It Down working on empowering cultural institutions with new technologies. Since freshman year at Vanderbilt University, pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering, he has expressed his passion for software development and entrepreneurship by founding a startup in Kenya for online grocery delivery, a video platform for college students to share events happening around campus and soon after college, founding Tryall, an award-winning software application for tracking subscription software for small and medium-sized startups. He began his journey in Elixir over a year ago and has an ever-growing passion for learning and applying it every day. When not glued to a screen he is probably cycling, running or reading.
