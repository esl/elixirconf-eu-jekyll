Software engineer, open-source contributor, organizer of the warsaw.ex meetup, IoT enthusiast. Loves building software that makes life easier. Currently Lead Architect at Fresha - helped the company adopt Elixir, migrate towards a service-oriented architecture, and introduce extensive application monitoring. Drinks way too much coffee, then complains he's twitchy.
