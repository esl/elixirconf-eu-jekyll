I'm a software engineer with over a decade of experience designing and building scalable, resilient backend systems. Currently working as a Staff Backend Engineer at Fresha, I specialize in Elixir and distributed architectures, helping teams craft asynchronous, event-driven solutions powered by Elixir & Kafka.

My roots in Python and Ruby give me a strong polyglot foundation and a pragmatic approach to complex engineering challenges. Outside of work, I enjoy exploring machine learning, particularly classification algorithms, unwinding with RPG games, and hiking.
