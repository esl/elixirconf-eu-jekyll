Software engineer and entrepreneur, I have been involved in several startups during the past years.
I have co-founded Spin42 with Loïc Vigneron and Marc Lainez in 2013. Together we have provided agile software consultancy, co-founded <a href="https://www.commuty.net/">Commuty</a> Smart Parking and corporate mobility and I'm member of the board. Later we launched <a href="https://ibanity.com">Ibanity</a>, an Open Banking aggregator written mainly in Elixir and sold to Isabel Group in 2017. At Isabel Group I've been head of product for Open Banking. Leading the Ibanity and <a href="https://myponto.com">Ponto</a> teams.
Together with Marc Lainez and Loïc Vigneron, we are now investigating how to create a more open environment in the automotive sector.
