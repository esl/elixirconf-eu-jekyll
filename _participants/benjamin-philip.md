Benjamin is an Elixir and Functional Programming enthusiast, and the maintainer of Erlang's Apache Arrow implementation. Though not a core contributor, he also frequently contributes to the Nx and Livebook projects with the occasional contributions to Hexpm and Hex. Being a 16 year old high schooler, he does not have any professional programming experience but he tries to contribute to Opensource whenever time permits.

In his free time he likes to read Non Fiction and Fantasy, listen to 70s and 80s music (and additionally grumble about how nobody at school shares his taste in music) and crack terrible jokes. Beware. He's bit of a Linux and Emacs zealot.
