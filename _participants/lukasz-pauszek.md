Łukasz is an Elixir consultant by day and specialty coffee enthusiast in the mornings. Having completed his Master’s in 2017, he started working on a social platform with Elixir and Phoenix. He is currently involved with MongooseIM, using Phoenix LiveView to craft applications. In his spare time, you can find him either playing PS5 games or tinkering with his Nvim configuration. When he is not drinking coffee, that is.
