I am a fourth-year PhD student at Remote and IRIF (Institut de Recherche en Informatique Fondamentale) in Paris, with a scholarship funded by Supabase, Fresha, and Dashbit. I have an MSc in Theoretical Computer Science from ENS de Lyon, where I developed a passion for functional programming. I have published two papers in programming languages, focusing on type inference and the practical implementation of gradual-typing systems, which can be found in my profile: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=e1pz8RIAAAAJ&hl=fr&authuser=3

I like finding novel ways to improve the programming experience, by bringing theory into practice.
