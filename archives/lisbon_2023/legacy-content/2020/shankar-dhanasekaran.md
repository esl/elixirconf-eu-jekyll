**Summary**

Drawing upon the experience of building LiveView powered ecommerce systems, Shankar Dhanasekaran will walk you through building specific features in LiveView.

**Description**

We start with an explanation of the theory around LiveView, its individual LiveView components in contrast to regular pages. We'll then dive deeper into modifying a simple ecommerce system, built using Phoenix, into one that is powered by LiveView. We'll add new features along the way, such as live updates showing "total users currently viewing each product," typical to many ecommerce websites.

By the end of the course, participants will have a good practical grounding in LiveView.
