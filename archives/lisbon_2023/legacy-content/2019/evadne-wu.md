Software Enthusiast – Believer in Live Demos – Grand Design Proposer

#### Leveraging ETS Effectively

ETS is pervasive, yet invisible. With this talk, Evadne shall take the audience on a deep dive into ETS, look at its internals, and ways to leverage it effectively within Elixir apps.

This talk will cover: 

*   ETS functions
*   Forming Match Specifications
*   Using ETS for ephemeral/preset data
*   Integrating ETS with Ecto (Schemas, Repos)
*   Emitting change notifications
*   Moving beyond ETS

The audience should leave with knowledge on when/where to use ETS, and a few patterns that they can reuse.

##### Objectives

To elicit appreciation of Erlang/OTP subsystems that are usually taken for granted. To promote further usage of core Erlang/OTP technologies in the Elixir community, so as to enable better products and services.

##### Audience

*   Developers who are curious about how the frameworks work
*   Fans of the Actor Model
*   People who want to see some actual code running in a demo
