CxO Koan CI

#### Designing with Elixir

When making UI/UX decisions, there is a tendency to start with 'pie in the sky' designs. These then need to be realised or cut down. Although this is a valid way to work, there are alternatives. At Koan CI, we have found that starting from a user point of view, of the expectations the Erlang/Elixir system needs to deliver, we then organise the top layers of the code with these in mind. Having the design of the interface layer in mind is beneficial to the quality of the design. It also increases the speed of delivery. Whether you are picking a Single Page App strategy or something else, this approach helps you make those strategic calls.

##### Objectives

This talk will go into API design and how that affects internal modules, EEX templates and when to use non-dynamic content, Channel usage, and Phoenix.LiveView. 

##### Audience

Elixir Developers that are working closely to the actual public interface (not simply the public interface to the module.)
