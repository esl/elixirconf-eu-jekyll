Got mentioned at the Nerves keynote at ElixirConf US 2018

#### Tortoise Evolved; The road to MQTT 5 support in the Tortoise MQTT Client

MQTT is a light-weight PubSub protocol used for machine to machine communication. It its often used in IoT applications, so it fits well in many Nerves projects. Tortoise is a MQTT client for Elixir. It started its life as a MQTT 3.1.1 client, but is in the progress of getting an upgrade to the latest version of MQTT; version 5. MartinÂ will introduce MQTT; give an overview of the new features in MQTT 5; how Tortoise is designed to make MQTT easy to work with in Elixir, and how MQTT 5 will influence that design.

##### Objectives

Give an introduction to MQTT - Show some use cases - Introduce the Elixir MQTT client called Tortoise - Talk about how the API of Tortoise came to be, and how changes in the MQTT specification will alter this design.

##### Audience

This should be interesting for people implementing protocols and protocol clients in Elixir, as well as answering why Tortoise is the way it is to people who just wanna use Tortoise.

Martin is a long time Elixir developer with a keen interest in implementing network protocols. For the last couple of years he has been working with Erlang and Elixir systems for a living, and during that time spent way too much time tinkering with his Emacs configuration. Besides that he has a horrible taste in music, enjoys coffee, mechanical keyboards, and is a friend of the podcast.
