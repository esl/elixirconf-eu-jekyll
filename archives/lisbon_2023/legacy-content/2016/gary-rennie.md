#### The Road to 2 Million Websocket Connections in Phoenix

This talk will discuss how the Phoenix team was able to create a single chat room with 2 million users on a single machine. Benchmarking WebSockets is a little more in depth than benchmarking HTTP requests, this talk covers the Tsung tool which was used for the benchmarks and how it can be configured for different testing scenarios. I will cover how Tsung was used to find the concurrent connection limits that Phoenix could handle. I will then cover the techniques that were used to find the parts of the Phoenix codebase with the bottlenecks that caused these limits and how these limits were overcome.

**Talk objectives**

Learn how to benchmark WebSockets using Tsung Explore how to find and fix bottlenecks.

**Target audience**

Anyone interested in Phoenix Channel performance.
