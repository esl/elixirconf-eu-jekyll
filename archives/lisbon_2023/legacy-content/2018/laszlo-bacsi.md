#### Robust Data Processing Pipeline with Elixir and Flow

It doesn't matter if you have "big data" or "small data" if you need to import and process it in near realtime you want to have a system that is robust and maintainable. This is where the failure tolerance and scalability of Erlang/OTP, the expressiveness of Elixir, and the flexibility of Flow and GenStage are all great assets. This is a story of how we built a data pipeline to move and process billions of rows from MySQL and CSV files into Redshift and what we learned along the way.
