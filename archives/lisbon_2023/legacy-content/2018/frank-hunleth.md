#### Training: Embedded Elixir Device Development with Nerves

This one-day workshop introduces attendees to embedded development with Elixir and Nerves for both the maker and professional embedded developer. The workshop includes real hardware so that attendees can apply what they learn and have the satisfaction of experiencing how networked embedded device development can be using Elixir. Topics include getting started with Nerves, creating an efficient development workflow, tips and tricks to working with hardware in Elixir, streaming video, and remotely managing and upgrading devices in the field. By the end of the workshop, attendees should be comfortable applying their Elixir programming skills to building robust embedded systems at home or for their job.

The workshop is appropriate for beginners and expert Elixir programmers alike since it focuses more on embedded development than pure coding. Beginners are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the basics of OTP beforehand.

Frank Hunleth designs embedded Linux-based software that can be found in products spanning the medical, consumer, telecommunications and defense industries. His work on high density VOIP switches in the 1990s eventually led him to discover Erlang. Since then, he has re-implemented Erlang design elements in everything from a cutting edge diabetic screening device at LKC Technologies to motion controlled UI frameworks at Hillcrest Labs. He started the open-source Nerves project to make it easier to use Erlang in a cross-compiled environment.
