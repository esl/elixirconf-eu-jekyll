Liefery

#### Your Monolith, Elixir and You

Elixir is great, so clearly we'll all rewrite our applications in Elixir. Mostly, you can't and shouldn't do that. This presentation will show you another path. You’ll see how at Liefery, we started with small steps instead of rewriting everything. This allowed us to reap the benefits earlier and get comfortable before getting deeper into it. We’ll examine in detail the tactics we used to create two Elixir apps for new requirements, and how we integrated them with our existing Rails code base.

Join us on our tale of adopting Elixir and Phoenix and see what we learned, what we loved, and what bumps we hit along the road.
