Head of Elixir @ Erlang Solutions

#### Always Available

Availability should be one of our major concerns when writing web applications, yet more often than not we ship code that is simply not resilient enough. Elixir and OTP provide powerful tools to improve resilience and increase availability: in this talk we'll look at how we can leverage them to provide continuous service even when our database is down. The talk will be a walkthrough of a refactor of an Elixir application with a Phoenix frontend, powered by PostgreSQL.
