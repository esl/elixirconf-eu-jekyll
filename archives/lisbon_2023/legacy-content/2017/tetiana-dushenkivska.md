#### Keynote: The Age of Elixir

The elixir of life is a mythical potion that supposedly grants the drinker eternal life and eternal youth. This elixir was said to cure all diseases. Alchemists in various ages and cultures sought the means of formulating the elixir. Today, thanks to José we can all use Elixir, and once you have tried, it's hard to stop. Why Elixir is so addictive? How is it transforming lives?  
  
In this talk we will take a fun peek at the development of Elixir, and remind ourselves how it all started. We’ll join a whistle stop tour through the years from inception, learning how both the language and the community got to where we are today. We’ll take a closer look at some examples of how elixir has transformed the lives of those who have jumped in with both feet. And finally we’ll take a cautious but brave look towards the future, what opportunities might lay in the road ahead.

I am working as a Software Engineer in Southampton. I have a degree in Electrical Engineering from Ukraine, and I am passionate about challenges and making learning fun. In my free time I contribute to open source and working on my own software/hardware projects. I like the idea of mixing hardware and software together. That's why my personal projects include integration of Arduino, bunch sensors with visual output to the browser. This allows me to write fun games and enjoy "testing" them. As a social person, I like to build social games, which include "testing" with friends. After sipping a little bit of Elixir (programming language, not actual booze) I started to fell in love with it. That's the explanation to why all my latest projects include Elixir.
