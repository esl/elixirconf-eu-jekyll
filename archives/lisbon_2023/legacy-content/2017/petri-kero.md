Cluster All The Things!

#### Building a Scalable, Distributed Backend for Mobile Games

Successful mobile games have huge amounts of simultaneous users, which requires a scalable server in the backend. Getting featured in a store can also cause a rapid rapid ramp-up, putting even further pressure on the scalability of the backend. In this talk I'll present how Ministry of Games is tackling the scalability problem with distributed Elixir. I will cover how our system is implemented in Elixir as well as some practical aspects of deploying the Elixir server to a Kubernetes cluster.
