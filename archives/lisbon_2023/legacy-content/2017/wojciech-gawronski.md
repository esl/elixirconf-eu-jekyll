#### Tutorial: Join the Elixir Fire Brigade - Level-up Your Elixir Debugging Skills

Both Erlang and Elixir are praised for their "debuggability". It's true - there's a lot of tools and techniques that can be used, even on live, production systems. Not only that - they are easily accessible and freely usable. Together we're going to explore them in depth.  
  
We're going to learn what exactly happens when you call a GenServer, how to "spy" on processes and introspect the VM internals. We're going to work with an example application - a basic key-value store built on top of plug, prepare a release for it and deploy it to production. Unfortunately, after the deployment we're going to discover some errors, we didn't anticipate. Fortunately, with the knowledge we gained earlier, we'll be able to diagnose and fix them - live in production!

**Target audience:**

*   Attendees should be familiar with syntax and basic features of either Elixir or Erlang. It is advised that all attendees complete the "[Mix and OTP tutorial](http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html)" before the workshop.
*   Participants should have Elixir >= 1.3 and Erlang >= 18 locally installed, together with their favorite editor.
