#### The Best Library I Ever Designed

I started learning Elixir by creating a couple of simple libraries, and have never stopped writing libraries since. In this process, I learned a lot about Elixir and Erlang, open source, API design, extensibility, documentation, and people. I tried to distil all of this in a data validation library called Saul. In this talk, I will share my learnings and thoughts on the library side of software, showing off Saul as a practical example.
