                    <div class="speaker-desc mt-0"><p>This talk covers the development and implementation of a digital assistant for humans in everyday life. It is based on digital twins for resources, activities and intentions. The assistants deliver an advanced situational awareness while leaving the decision-making with the humans. The assistants continuously interact to update this shared awareness of future interaction.</p>

<p>Digital assistants interact through quantum doodles. Quantum doodles are not limited to organizing a meeting. Benefiting from Elixir’s expressive power, a quantum doodle may coordinate parking space, staffing a reception desk, … It also supports ‘entanglement’ where the information reflects how one doodle is affected by other doodles.</p>

<p>This talk provides a demonstration, which addresses concrete test cases in everyday life. To implement digital twins for everyday activities, a software tool needs expressive power that matches this. Elixir is unbeatable in this respect, which the presentation discusses.</p>

<p><strong>Talk objectives:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Expand the range of possible applications and interesting application areas for Elixir (and the beam) in the minds of the Elixir community.</li>
  <li>Show how Elixir is key to developing applications into new territories.</li>
  <li>Present a starting point for innovative business as well as R&amp;D opportunities.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Target audience:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Persons interested in novel applications (domains) for Elixir.</li>
  <li>Businesses interested in developing their own assets, beyond providing services, by capturing and crystallizing application domain knowledge into (Elixir) software, which is precisely what digital twin development does.</li>
  <li>Persons who’d like a digital assistant handling everyday activity management for them.</li>
</ul>
