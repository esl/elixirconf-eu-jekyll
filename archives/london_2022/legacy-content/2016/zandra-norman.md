#### Scaling Distributed Erlang

One of the great things with Erlang is how easy it is to distribute. Distributed Erlang makes applications transparent when porting them from a single computer to multiple computers in a network. There are still areas for improvement though, and the OTP team is working on improving the scalability and services of Distributed Erlang. In this talk we'll see what plans we have for the Erlang Distribution.

**Talk objectives:**

\- How Distributed Erlang works today, some issues with it and how to avoid them

\- The future of Distributed Erlang

**Target audience:**

\- Anyone interested in building scalable applications with Elixir or Erlang
