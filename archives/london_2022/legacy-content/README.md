What's in here ? 

The talk abstracts from all the previous years - some markdown artefacts remain but most is cleaned.

The content is under the following folders - for example :

     2015
     2016
     2017
     2018
     2019
     2020


For example: 

     ./2015/
     ./2015//viktoria-fordos.md
     .. etc etc

The res folder contains all the speaker images and slides from previous years - it's perhaps interesting for historic reasons - greatly bloats the github repo size - sorry - we can remove, or use large file support or just throw them all in a linked google drive folder or whatever is most pragmantic later.

The res folder is structured into a speakers folder and a slides folder and two top level csv files with metadata about the files (year,name,filename) the csv files are called res/slides.csv and res/speakers.csv

For example : 

     ./res/
     ./res//speakers
     ./res//speakers/Gary_Rennie.jpeg
     ./res//slides/Credo_-_Analysing_ASTs_for_Fun_and_Profit_-_René_Föhring.pdf
     ./res//speakers.csv
     ./res//slides.csv

Take a look and see what you think is the best thing to do with it.
