#### Background Processing with RabbitMQ

At SQUARE ENIX, we recently opensourced a background processing library called [TaskBunny](https://github.com/shinyscorpion/task_bunny). In this talk, we will go through:

*   the design decision we made to use RabbitMQ instead of using Erlang process/OTP
*   the features the libraries offer
*   some implementations we like to share. For example, how TaskBunny uses the OTP supervisor to handle connection loss

Additionally we want to share our story on how we came to opensource our library. We were hesitant to opensource at first, because we thought that using RabbitMQ for background processing wouldn't look attractive to Elixir/Erlang developers. But we did it anyway and we are very happy about it. We hope our story will encourage other developers and teams to share their works as well.
