#### DBConnection - Ecto's SQL Sandbox

The DBConnection framework was introduced in Ecto 2.0. It increased performance and introduced the concurrent testing sandbox. We will look under the hood of Ecto to understand why it was written, how it works, what issues occurred, and how to take full advantage of the optimisations and the sandbox.
