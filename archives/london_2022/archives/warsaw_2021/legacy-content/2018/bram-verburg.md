#### Training: Practical security for Elixir/Phoenix

This course is a hands-on overview of security aspects around the Erlang/Elixir ecosystem, including (but not limited to) Phoenix web applications and APIs. Topics include: exploration of a deliberately vulnerable application, techniques and tools for security scanning, analysis of past vulnerabilities, and practical topics such as the correct use of security-related Plugs, TLS client/server configuration, use of Erlang's crypto library, and Erlang distribution protocol.

  

**Course TLDR**

Erlang and Elixir make it easy to take your application to the next level in terms of robustness and scalability; don't forget to level up your security as well!
