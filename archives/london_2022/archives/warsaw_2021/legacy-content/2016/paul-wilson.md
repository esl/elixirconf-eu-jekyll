#### How to Build a Slack-Controlled, Saxophone-Playing Robot (on Wheels) Using Elixir and Nerves

Starting with a brief explanation for why Elixir is an excellent choice for embedded systems, we will look at how to building a cool Elixir robot, using \[Nerves\](http://nerves-project.org). ​ You will learn how to: ​ \* get started (often the hardest part) \* structure an embedded OTP appplication \* customise an embedded linux using Buildroot/Nerves \* control your robot using an embedded web server \* control your robot with \[Slack\](https://slack.com) ​ You will leave this presentation with more than just inspiration; you will have an actionable plan to make something fun with embedded Elixir. You will also have a genuine stepping stone towards creating a robust and secure \_Internet of Things\_ product.

**Talk objectives**

The audience should leave with a clear understanding of how to get started with embedded Elixir. It will be a practical, rather than purely inspirational talk.

**Target audience**

Those with some Elixir knowledge, but no experience of using Nerves to embed Elixir.
