#### Keynote: The Age of Elixir

The elixir of life is a mythical potion that supposedly grants the drinker eternal life and eternal youth. This elixir was said to cure all diseases. Alchemists in various ages and cultures sought the means of formulating the elixir. Today, thanks to José we can all use Elixir, and once you have tried, it's hard to stop. Why Elixir is so addictive? How is it transforming lives?  
  
In this talk we will take a fun peek at the development of Elixir, and remind ourselves how it all started. We’ll join a whistle stop tour through the years from inception, learning how both the language and the community got to where we are today. We’ll take a closer look at some examples of how elixir has transformed the lives of those who have jumped in with both feet. And finally we’ll take a cautious but brave look towards the future, what opportunities might lay in the road ahead.
