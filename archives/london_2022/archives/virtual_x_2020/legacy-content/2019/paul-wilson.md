Programmer, speaker, founder, CEO Cultivate Software

#### A production-grade Nerves System

Cultivate’s “Office Window System” is a view into the office for our remote employees. It consists of cameras on Pi Zeros relaying websocket-based streams through a cloud-based Phoenix server. Attendees will learn how they made the system: robust, secure, and performant. Paul will demonstrate developing and unit-testing nerves code on development hardware, using umbrella applications to separate concerns, and using OTP supervision trees to make an ultra-reliable system despite intermittent library bugs.

##### Objectives

To give a detailed overview of making this Nerves system, with a particular emphasis on robustness, quality, and extensibility. The demonstration part, will work with or without conference WiFi.

##### Audience

This talk will be of interest to Elixir programmers who are interested in how to take Nerves beyond toy applications.

Paul is a coder with over 20 years experience, including working with C, C++, Visual Basic, Java, Ruby, and Elixir. Paul has spoken at various conferences including RubyConf, Elixir Conf EU, The Naked Agilist, Agile Scotland, XP Conf. While Paul is now CEO of Cultivate Software, he still codes and is overly proud of the small contributions he has made to Elixir Core, Nerves, and Phoenix.
