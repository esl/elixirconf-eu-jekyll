Josh is the CTO of Isotope11, a successful software development company that focuses on Ruby and JavaScript. He is also responsible for [http://www.elixirsips.com](http://www.elixirsips.com), a screencast series wherein he walks through elixir as he learns it, and records 2 shortish (5-12 minutes, occasionally longer) videos per week. He's also been a co-author and a technical reviewer for multiple books on the Arduino microprocessor, and has had a lot of fun doing robotics with Ruby as well. Josh is currently aiming to bring that robotics fun to Erlang (or Elixir).
