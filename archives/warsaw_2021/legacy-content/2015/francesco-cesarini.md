#### Scale, Manage and Prevent!

Making distributed systems that scale to many machines is easier done with Erlang/OTP than most other technologies. Deploying, managing and monitoring thousands of Erlang nodes prepared for massive load, however, remains a tough (and repetitive) challenge. In the context of the EU funded RELEASE project, the main task of WombatOAM is to provide the scalable infrastructure for deploying thousands of Erlang nodes. It provides a broker layer capable of dynamically scaling heterogeneous cloud clusters based on capability profile matching.

In this talk, I will tell you how the scalability and robustness capabilities of WombatOAM were addressed, allowing us to deploy and monitor 10,000 Erlang nodes running an ant farm simulation in 4 minutes. The talk will cover the journey – focusing on the analysis of WombatOAM (using WombatOAM, as we like dog food), on the applied techniques and on the key decisions taken when advancing WombatOAM.

**Talk objectives:**

*   Learn how to detect bottlenecks in concurrent system.
*   Explore an approach to scaling Erlang clusters.
*   Discover how to predict and prevent possible outages.

**Target audience:**

Developers, Support and Operations staff who believe devops is the way (and do not want to be woken up at night).

Francesco Cesarini is the founder of Erlang Solutions Ltd. He has used Erlang on a daily basis since 1995, starting as an intern at Ericsson’s computer science laboratory, the birthplace of Erlang. He moved on to Ericsson’s Erlang training and consulting arm working on the first release of OTP, applying it to turnkey solutions and flagship telecom applications. In 1999, soon after Erlang was released as open source, he founded Erlang Solutions, who have become the world leaders in Erlang based consulting, contracting, training and systems development. Francesco has worked in major Erlang based projects both within and outside Ericsson, and as Technical Director, has led the development and consulting teams at Erlang Solutions. He is also the co-author of '[Erlang Programming](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596518189.do)' and '[Designing for Scalability with Erlang/OTP](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024149.do)' both published by O'Reilly and lectures at Oxford University.
