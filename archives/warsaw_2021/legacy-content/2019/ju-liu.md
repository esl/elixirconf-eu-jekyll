#### Live coding an Escher painting using Scenic

In this talk we will be rebuilding "Square Limit", a famous painting by M.C. Escher using Scenic and the amazing powers of functional programming. We will build the whole application from scratch, and we will start by taking a look at how Scenic works. We will then proceed to deconstruct the fractal nature of Escher's painting and then rebuild it step by step. By the end of the talk, we should have acquired a good level of understanding on how Scenic works and a lot of respect for Escher's work as a mathematician.

##### Objectives

Explain how Scenic works at a basic level - Showcase the power of functional programming - Compose very simple concepts into amazingly complex artifacts.

##### Audience

People who are interested in Scenic, visual art and fractals.

Ju was born in a metropolis in China, then moved as a kid to the sunny italian countryside. He got a degree in Computer Science and cofounded a consulting company in Turin. After some time, he started a new adventure and moved to London, where he joined AlphaSights as a Lead Engineer. He loves to solve hard problems and build amazing products. When he’s not doing that, he’s probably rock climbing.
