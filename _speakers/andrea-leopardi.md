talk: Mint - Disrupting HTTP clients
abstract: Mint is a young HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 client for Elixir that aims at disrupting
  the status quo of HTTP clients for Erlang and Elixir. Mint is built on the idea
  of having a functional, data-centric client that is not backed up by a process and
  doesn't impose a process architecture on its users. In this talk, we'll discuss
  the ideas behind Mint's design and get a feel of how Mint works. We'll spend some
  time exploring how the low-level interface that Mint provides lets us build different
  abstractions on top of it that are suited for different situations. We'll see the
  future of Mint and what abstractions it will enable.
