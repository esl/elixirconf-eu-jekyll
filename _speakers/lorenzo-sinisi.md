talk: Artificial intelligence with Elixir: the Rete algorithm to build Expert Systems
abstract: The Rete algorithm is an algorithm for implementing rule-based systems. It is known as one of the most complex algorithm to implement and it is used in the field of Artificial Intelligence. 
So can Elixir be used for Artificial Intelligence to build expert systems? Let's find out!
I showcase an Elixir app in which we detect the sickness of a plant given a set of symptoms using Retex as the core business logic of the app. I demonstrate that AI on the BEAM works amazingly.
