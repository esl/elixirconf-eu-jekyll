lastname: Vámosi
position: A visual thinker, working on making BEAM big in the aviation industry
talk: Visual concurrency cookbook
abstract: While building an air travel distribution system, the number and variety of concurrency patterns we need to evaluate and apply can be vast. Sometimes OTP comes to the rescue, sometimes good tricks from the community, sometimes our own designs. I have been prototyping visualisation tools for the BEAM for few years already, also gave same talks around the topic. This time I would like to use these tools to tell our journey and present our learnings through a visual concurrency cookbook.
audience: Intermediate
bio: DÃ¡niel started as architect (not software) 15 years ago, then he gradually switched to software development and later engineering management. Since 2016 January DÃ¡niel is leading the tech for flyiin.com and bringing BEAM technologies to the aviation industry.
