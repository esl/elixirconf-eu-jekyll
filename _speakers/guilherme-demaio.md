<p>Iâ€™m a software engineer with 10 years of experience, focused on web applications, from ops to backend. Currently working at Telnyx, a CPaSS company aiming at democratizing universal communications.
Iâ€™ve been in love Elixir since I started working with the language in 2015, being an active member of Elixir Meetups in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil and spreading Elixir love all around :)
