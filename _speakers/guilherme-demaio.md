lastname: de Maio
position: Software Engineer in love with Elixir/Erlang
talk: Crashing BEAM applications
abstract: We often talk about embracing failures and making resilient applications, and how BEAM helps us do that. Nonetheless, there are several ways you can write code that will crash your application, and sometimes the whole VM! This talk is about those things, showing several ways I may or may have not managed to crash BEAM in the past, some obvious, and some not that obvious ;)
audience: Intermediate
bio: Guilherme is a software engineer with 10 years' of experience, focusing on web applications, from ops to backend. Currently working at Telnyx, a CPaSS company aiming at democratizing universal communications.
Guilherme has been in love Elixir since I started working with the language in 2015, being an active member of Elixir Meetups in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil and spreading Elixir love all around :)
