talk: If you want to master "Elixir", teach it!
abstract: This presentation is about explaining the core concepts of elixir (functional?, immutability, pattern matching, pipelines, concurrency) in a simple way through examples and sharing the resources that helped me. I am an advocate for diversity and inclusion for women and underrepresented groups in tech and I believe that knowledge sharing, mentoring and teaching is one of the best ways to growth as an engineer, develop leadership skills and promote more inclusion and diversity within the industry.
audience: Beginner

Born and raised in Peru, she studied business administration at the Vienna University of Economics and Business and at the London School of Economics. Volunteering at Women in Tech PerÃº(WIT) she soon realised that technology can be a key tool for social transformation.
