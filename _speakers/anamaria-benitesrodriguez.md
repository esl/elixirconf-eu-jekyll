position:
talk: If you want to master Elixir, teach it!
abstract: This presentation is about explaining the core concepts of elixir in a simple way through examples and sharing the resources that helped me. I am an advocate for diversity and inclusion for women and underrepresented groups in tech and I believe that knowledge sharing, mentoring and teaching is one of the best ways to growth as an engineer, develop leadership skills and promote more inclusion and diversity within the industry.
