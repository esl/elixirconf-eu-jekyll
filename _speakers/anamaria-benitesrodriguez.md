position:
talk: If you want to master Elixir, teach it!
abstract: This presentation is about explaining the core concepts of elixir (functional?, immutability, pattern matching, pipelines, concurrency) in a simple way through examples and sharing the resources that helped me. I am an advocate for diversity and inclusion for women and underrepresented groups in tech and I believe that knowledge sharing, mentoring and teaching is one of the best ways to growth as an engineer, develop leadership skills and promote more inclusion and diversity within the industry.
audience: Beginner
bio: Ana Benites, the project leader of the online accountability study group at Anitab.org, has made the empowerment of women in technology one of her major points of interest.

Volunteering at Women in Tech PerÃº(WIT) she soon realised that technology can be a key tool for social transformation. Having worked in the foreign trade sector, mining industry and tourism and hospitality management, she decided to a career transition into software engineering.
