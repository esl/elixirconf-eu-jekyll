talk: Deploying Phoenix at the speed of light
abstract: CI/CD systems and docker can become frustrating to work with when your project grows. Especially with monorepo-projects like Phoenix, where you ship frontend and backend as part of the same release, the days where you could quickly fix a typo or styling mistake on the server are finally behind us. Luckily we can leverage the dynamic nature of the BEAM to enable faster updates, even in a container. In this talk I will present several methods to speed up the deployment of frontend assets and templates.
audience: Intermediate
