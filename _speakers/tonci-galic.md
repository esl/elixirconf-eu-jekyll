talk: Livecoding a WebAssembly interpreter
abstract: One of the exciting announcements this year was Lumen, an alternative BEAM implementation designed for WebAssembly. But wat is WebAssembly actually and why has it received so much news lately, as it is even the newest recommandation (besides HTML, CSS and JS) by the WWW Consortium and 4th language to run natively in the browser. In this talk we'll zoom into the details and demystify some of it's magic by building a WASM interpreter in Elixir.
audience: Intermediate
