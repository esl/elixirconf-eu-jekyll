abstract: This talk is not only about building the game Minesweeper from scratch but also to make coding with Elixir a fun experience.
For a newbie, functional programming can get quite challenging. So, to make things enjoyable, I will use Phoenix LiveView interestingly and build a game in under 40 minutes. I will also talk about the difficulties I encountered while adopting Elixir, how I overcame it utilising various resources and talk about where to look for some tips and tricks.

bio: A Software Developer who's journey began as a Java developer followed by a QA Engineer and then an Elixir Developer. Having finished my Master's in Software Engineering, I love exploring new technologies and utilising them both in my personal and professional life. When I am not coding, I am usually travelling, relaxing or socialising.
