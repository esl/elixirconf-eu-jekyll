In this talk, Jos√© Valim will explore the classical Gang of Four (Design Patterns) book and answer the question if they are applicable to Elixir programs or not. We will also talk about objects, how we can understand and deconstruct them from Elixir's perspective, and how such deconstruction impacts the design of large systems.
