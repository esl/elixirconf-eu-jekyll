In this keynote, Homicide Detective and Offender Profiler Crux Conception teams up with Adam Tornhill to investigate novel ways of analyzing source code and organizations. Starting from the perspective of real-world crime scenes, we learn about behavioral patterns and their consequences. We then transfer those learnings to a software context to investigate the traces we developers leave behind as we evolve our code. We explore how these techniques let us prioritize refactoring based on impact, detect high-risk areas of code, as well as visualizing the organizational side of our software architecture. The techniques are pragmatic and illustrated on real-world codebases like Elixir's Phoenix framework. Join in -- your code deserves it!
