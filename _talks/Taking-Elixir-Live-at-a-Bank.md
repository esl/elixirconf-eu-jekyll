 At OP Labs we have developed a payment system based on facial recognition (Pivo Kasvomaksu in Finnish). This being used at several coffee shops in Finland and is the first of its kind launched in Europe. It is also the first Elixir production system in use at OP Financial Group.
 
 
 We have two main topics to present:
 
 â€¢ How we managed to develop a production Elixir system at a bank, and the unique requirements and challenges we faced in this setting,
 
 â€¢ Highlight of our experiences with Elixir, showcasing some of the key architectural benefits.</p>
