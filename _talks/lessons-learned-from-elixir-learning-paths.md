After 3 years of following the Elixir journey, I have found happy and unhappy paths that I would like to structure and share in this talk.   
  
I had the privilege of being part of the Plataformatec team and be immersed directly or indirectly in the Elixir world from 2018 to 2020. We had recurrent study groups, tech talks, and chapter meetings to learn, review, and discuss the technical and non-technical aspects of the software engineering path.  
  
Now, after so many unexpected changes and working for a new company, I see how important was Plataformatec in my professional life; how many lessons I learned as a consultant and as a software engineer; and how my study habits had to be adapted to this remote world.   
  
In this talk, I will summarize this experience and present my current project to learn and teach Elixir.
