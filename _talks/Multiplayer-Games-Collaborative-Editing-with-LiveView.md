<p>In this talk, I'll explain and share my experiences on how Elixir, Phoenix and LiveView can be used to create web-applications in which multiple users are collaborating in real-time like collaborative document editing and multiplayer games.
 
 This talk is geared to a beginner-intermediate audience that might know some Elixir but might be new to LiveView and new to creating real-time multi-user systems. Some game-development techniques will be explained as well.</p>
