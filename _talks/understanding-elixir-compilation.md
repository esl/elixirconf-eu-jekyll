Struggling with slow Elixir compile times? Do you change just a single file and re-run your test, but it compiles tens of files and takes ages? This interactive talk will go through a number of examples to help you understand which files get recompiled and why. After the talk, you'll be able to better understand compile-time dependencies in your own codebase and follow some common practices to reduce your compile-time dependencies.

**Talk objectives:**	
* Help you understand how Elixir's compiler decides which files need to be recompiled when you update a file
* Help you understand ways to reduce your compile-time dependencies and speed up your compilation time

**Target audience:**
* Any Elixir developers who have struggled with slow incremental compilation
