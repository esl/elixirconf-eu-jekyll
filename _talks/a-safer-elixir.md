Writing error-free code has been the developer’s dream but with growing codebases, there’s not always enough time to think of all edge cases and, as years go by, you get back to this code and think: “Maybe it’s a good idea to refactor this”. Refactoring can be tedious and risky depending on how big this process might be.  
  
In this talk, we’ll see how we can write safer code in Elixir, using the built-in features of the language, and how this can help us improve the maintenance of the codebase.
