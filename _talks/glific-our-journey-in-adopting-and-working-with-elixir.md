In our session, we'll share about our journey at Project Tech4Dev in building Glific using Elixir. Glific is an open-source, WhatsApp-based, two-way communication platform for non-profit organizations. It helps these organizations increase their reach and impact on the communities they serve. . Glific has split tech architecture, with the backend running on Elixir using Phoenix framework and the frontend on React. It is a multi-tenant application that simplifies maintenance and reduces costs.

Glific development started during the pandemic when physical interaction with end-users was restricted and an alternate communication medium was needed. We chose Whatsapp due to it’s popularity in the Global South countries. Today, Glific is used by over 100 non-profits in India, with more than 100 concurrent instances running. We'll share more on how non-profit organizations are using Glific to have high-quality, relevant, and timely communication with their communities at a minimal cost.
