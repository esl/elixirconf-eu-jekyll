What is it that makes some start-ups fail and others flourish? There are multiple variables when answering this question, but a key ingredient is always speed â€“ of delivering, of adapting and of finding product-market fit.

Elixir has been focused on productivity from the start, from great tooling to comprehensive documentation. Currently with LiveView, this can now be extended to the full-stack, truly allowing the merge of front and back-end developer teams.

<a href="https://www.getsona.com">Sona</a> is a ~2 year-old start-up that uses LiveView from its dawn. After joining, I got to see my first BIG LiveView application.

While daunting at first, the whole LiveView programming model, tooling, and full-stack ownership allowed me to be productive from the outset.

In this talk we'll see how LiveView enables us to build complex features with great UX, and in a shorter amount of time than traditional choices. Lastly, we'll explore some tips on how a new-joiner can navigate a large LiveView project.
