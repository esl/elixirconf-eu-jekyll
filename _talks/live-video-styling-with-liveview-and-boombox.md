Have you ever considered adding a multimedia layer to your Phoenix application?

In my upcoming talk, I will show you just how straightforward this can be using Boombox and Membrane.WebRTC.Live.

We'll begin with a demonstration of how to establish a relay between a browser and an Elixir server using LiveView components. Next, I'll illustrate how to utilize Boombox to enhance ingested multimedia streams with generative AI models. To wrap up, I'll present a demo where I apply AI-generated style transfer to a live stream from my personal camera, bringing all these elements together seamlessly.


**Key Takeaways:**
- how to use Boombox within a Phoenix application
- how to use Membrane.WebRTC.Live library to establish a live multimedia connection between a browser and an Elixir server using ready-to-use LiveView components
- how to use Boombox, to ingest multimedia streams, process them in Elixir and stream them further using state-of-the-art network protocols, e.g. WebRTC
- how to integrate Boombox with a generative AI model that produces video


**Target Audience:**
- People interested in learning how to handle multimedia streams within a LiveView.
- People interested in using AI to process or generate video.
- People interested in adding a multimedia layer into their Elixir application
- People who are looking for a simpler-to-use alternative to the Membrane Framework.
