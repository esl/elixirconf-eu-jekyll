wasmCloud is a secure, distributed, cloud native actor system runtime that lets developers define and deploy business logic as WebAssembly files (actors). This session walks you through the journey from a pure Rust runtime to a Rust and Elixir/OTP hybrid--learn the what, why, and how of this transition to an even more powerful, robust cloud service. Learn about some of the amazing things we were able to do "for free" that were impossible in the previous architecture.
