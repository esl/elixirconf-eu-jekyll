The Elixir programming language ecosystem has been steadily evolving, celebrating 13 years since its release. Built on solid foundations, Elixir boasts a vibrant and respected global community, evidenced by its many books, resources, and active groups.

Companies that adopted Elixir early are now nearing a decade of using it in production.

At Árvore, a leading Brazilian edtech, we adopted Elixir in 2016 as an alternative to the frameworks available at the time. Since then, it has powered our monolith and one additional service. In this talk, I’ll share our journey with Elixir—how we started, the challenges we faced, and how we’ve grown alongside the language.

Join me to learn what it takes for an edtech company to adopt, maintain, and scale Elixir in production, along with the lessons and strategies we’ve developed to tackle challenges over the past eight years.

**Key Takeaways:**
I want to give the audience insight into the challenges we faced over the past eight years and how we overcame them.

This includes topics such as hiring, adoption, scaling the application, the frameworks and libraries we use, and how we manage the codebase.

**Target Audience:**
- This talk is ideal for beginners looking to understand how a codebase evolves over time and the challenges that come with it.
- It also offers valuable insights for intermediate developers, as I will touch on technical topics such as scaling, codebase management, and the adoption of frameworks and libraries. Whether you’re starting your journey or already have some experience, this talk provides a balanced mix of high-level concepts and practical examples.
