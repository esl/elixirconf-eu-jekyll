This talk aims to demystify the inner workings of Erlang/OTP behaviours, providing attendees with a comprehensive understanding of how these abstractions facilitate the development of scalable and maintainable applications. We will examine the underlying mechanisms that enable behaviours to function seamlessly, including an analysis of the callback functions, state management, and message-passing protocols that are integral to their operation.
