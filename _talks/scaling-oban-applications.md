Perhaps you've heard the common refrain that relational database backed queues don't scale. Well,
times have changed, databases have improved, and for Elixir the BEAM gives us a leg up. Every day real-world applications use Oban to process tens-of-millions of a jobs a day across clusters of all sizes.

Come learn about the common pain-points impacting the growth of Oban applications and how you can avoid them. Together, we'll identify the underlying causes of common problems and explore step-by-step strategies to mitigate them (spoiler, it's bloat).

Armed with a better understanding of how Oban operates at scale, you can prevent common issues before you encounter them and plan for the future as your application booms.
