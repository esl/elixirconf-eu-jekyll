In this session, developers will learn how to trace and instrument their Elixir applications to improve performance and fix issues quickly. We will start with the basics of tracing and instrumentation, explaining why they are important. Attendees will then be introduced to various tracing tools and the OpenTelemetry library. Through a demo, attendees will learn how to set up tracing, analyze trace data, and fine-tune their applications. Real-world examples will show how tracing and instrumentation solve complex issues in live environments. By the end, attendees will have the practical skills to effectively trace and instrument their Elixir applications. This session is ideal for anyone looking to enhance their Elixir applications' performance and reliability.
