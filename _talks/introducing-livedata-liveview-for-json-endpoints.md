LiveView has provided a new way of making interactive UIs with Phoenix. However, it also has its limits. You can only work with HTML-based user interfaces in the browser. LiveData attempts to generalize the ideas behind LiveView to work with JSON, which has a wide range of uses: 

\* Easy integration with Javascript apps 

\* LiveView-like development of mobile apps 

\* Redux pattern over the network 

This talk will give an introduction to the tech behind LiveData, before diving into some potential applications.

**Talk objectives:**

Announce and provide an introduction to the LiveData library I have been working on for a while.

**Target audience:**

Anyone with an interest in Phoenix/LiveView, and how it can be generalized to work with JSON data.
