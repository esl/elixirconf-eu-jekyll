In a perfect world, debugging wouldn't exist.  
  
It's not a perfect world, and we have to deal with bugs and tackle them. Elixir and Erlang have plenty to offer in this area - with tools and approaches that are sometimes little-known and overlooked.  
  
We'll talk about the state-of-art Elixir debugging tools, and how we can utilize them and approach debugging efficiently - as well as point out how the language could improve on this.
