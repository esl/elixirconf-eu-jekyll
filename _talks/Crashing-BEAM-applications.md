We often talk about embracing failures and making resilient applications, and how BEAM helps us do that. Nonetheless, there are several ways you can write code that will crash your application, and sometimes the whole VM! This talk is about those things, showing several ways, Guilherme may or may not have managed to crash the BEAM in the past, some obvious, and some not that obvious ;)
