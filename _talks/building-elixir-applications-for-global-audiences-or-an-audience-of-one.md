---
Localising applications in Elixir for global audiences - or just an audience of one - doesn't have to be difficult. In this session, we'll define some design patterns and workflows using common Elixir libraries to build a simple e-commerce application showing how localisation can improve user experience and deliver better audience engagement.

  
**Talk objectives:**

* Show that building localised applications for global audiences - or just an audience of one - can be as easy as building non-localised applications.
* Demonstrate these techniques and tools by building a simple e-commerce system during the session.
* Illustrate simple design patterns and workflows to make localisation simple and fun.

**Target audience:**

* Developers looking to deliver improved user experience, who recognise that respecting users preferences (like language, formats, ...) improves audience engagement and delivers better outcomes.
