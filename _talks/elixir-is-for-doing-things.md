Elixir and Erlang were created to solve problems in the real world. OTP is not just gen_servers and supervisors but a maximalist, batteries included standard library with a deep set documented and undocumented tools. And thanks to NIF’s there really is no limit to what we can accomplish on our computers. Join me on an exploration of some of OTP’s internals and hidden modules and learn about the incredible power of NIF’s.

**Key Takeaways:**

- OTP Is full of really useful modules and libraries and even some undocumented ones
- Rustler/Zigler(and LLMS) make NIF's REALLY easy to do, anyone can do it now, just do it!
- AI is stupid good at Elixir with no special prompt required

**Target Audience:**

- anyone curious about the Elixir, the BEAM and Nifs
