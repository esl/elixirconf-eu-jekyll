When Adpipe started, we used Elixir and Phoenix Live View as our tech stack. We believe the choice has propelled us forward, allowing us to develop faster than any of us have in our careers before. As an early stage company, this speed has been crucial to our success in delivering MVPs and iterating quickly.
