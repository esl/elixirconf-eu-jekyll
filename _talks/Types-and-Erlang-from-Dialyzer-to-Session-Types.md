title: Types and Erlang from Dialyzer to session types
audience: Beginner
---

<p>Considering Erlang is widely known by its focus on fault-tolerance and, by consequence, guarantees of reliability, there have been several attempts to improve Erlang programs by proving their correctness with type systems but such attempts have failed. This talk proposes to explain what is a type system, why attempts to type strictly Erlang have failed and how the theory of Session Types might prove to be a way to achieve correctness in environments like Erlang's.</p>
