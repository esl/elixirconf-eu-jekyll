Ash is a powerful framework for rapid application development in Elixir. Its declarative approach allows developers to focus more on the business logic that drives value in their applications.The learning curve can feel daunting, however, Ash can improve developer productivity and make your codebase more maintainable.

I’ll share my experience integrating Ash into an existing project serving real customers in production. This involved replacing an existing phx.gen.auth authentication and authorization system with **AshAuthentication** and policies, as well as interfacing with external APIs.

I’ll dive into how I extended AshAuthentication to handle these unique use cases, leveraging Ash’s flexibility to build custom extensions.

I'll also share how we navigated the adoption process, from initial resistance to eventual success, and offer practical advice on how to introduce new tools within your team effectively.

**Key Takeaways:**
By the end of this session, you'll gain insight into how Ash can be used to streamline application development, improve maintainability, and drive consistency across your codebase, even when working with existing Phoenix codebases or third-party integrations.
