Since introducing Hologram at ElixirConf 2025, development has focused on building the foundations needed for Local-First applications with pure Elixir in the browser. This talk charts Hologram's journey over the past year, showcasing concrete progress in client-side capabilities and developer tooling - each piece moving closer to true Local-First functionality. I'll demonstrate practical examples of enhanced client-side features built entirely in Elixir, discuss the architectural decisions that enable offline-first patterns, and explain how each improvement contributes to the larger Local-First vision. Attendees will see working code, understand the technical building blocks required for Local-First applications, and learn about the roadmap for bringing full Local-First capabilities to the Elixir ecosystem.

**Key Takeaways:**

- What's new in Hologram since ElixirConf 2025
- How Hologram is building toward Local-First capabilities
- What's coming next on the roadmap

**Target Audience:**

- Elixir and Phoenix developers interested in Local-First application architecture and building offline-capable web apps. Valuable for those who saw the 2025 introduction and want to understand Hologram's evolution, as well as developers exploring alternatives to JavaScript-heavy frontend stacks.
