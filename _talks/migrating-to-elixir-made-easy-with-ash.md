Our journey into Elixir started last year. We chose Ash as an integral part of our stack. The talk will showcase the features of Ash we used to create our Graphql Backend, as well as the escape hatches we used to get all we needed done. It should also highlight what we learned about Ash along the way and the more advanced features like writing your own extensions to centralize common functionality.

I gave an initial version of this talk at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcLIpIWhQ6g&t=5s">Elixir Australia</a> and would like to go a bit deeper into some of the features mentioned.
