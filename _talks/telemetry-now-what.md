Telemetry is a beautiful tool but how do you use it? If you are like me, you read the docs and saw how the functions work but couldnâ€™t piece together the best ways to implement them. What patterns are there? How can I use it to create my metrics and extend my tracing? My goal with this talk is to help teams take the pieces they find about telemetry and show them how to work it into a production application. We will go over different patterns we use at Ramp and things to watch out for.

**Talk objectives:**

* Show how to fit the piece of telemetry together in a working application
* Show some pitfalls of telemetry
* How to use telemetry to extend tracing and metrics

**Target audience:**

People who are new to Elixir or whose team has just adopted it and need help getting the instrumentation setup in the Elixir way.
