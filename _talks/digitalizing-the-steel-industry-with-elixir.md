Kloeckner.i is the innovation hub of international steel distributor.Kl√∂ckner & Co. The software we build helps to drive our company's transformation towards a digital platform.

Since the steel industry has its own unique requirements, we often find ourselves in situations where our solutions need to support a variety of industry and country specific use cases and user workflows.

In this talk, we will explore how we addressed some of the unique challenges that our industry imposes and how elixir along with our inhouse-built event platform is helping us to realize our digitalisation efforts.
