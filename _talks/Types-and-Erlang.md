audience: Beginner

<p>Considering Erlang is widely known for its focus on fault-tolerance, and consequently its guarantees of reliability - there have been several attempts to improve Erlang programs by proving their correctness with type systems but such attempts have failed.<br /><br />
 This talk proposes to explain what is a type system, why attempts to type strictly Erlang have failed and how the theory of Session Types might prove to be a way to achieve correctness in environments like Erlang's.</p>
