Oban Web, the live dashboard for Oban, is fully open source! Now we can properly share the internals of a complex, battle tested, real-world, and formerly commercial LiveView app.

After a tour of foundational elements such as page structure and the table system, we'll delve into exotic features like real-time charts, integrated combo boxes, autocompletion, complex queries that don't grind the database to a halt, and more.

Additionally, we'll investigate Oban Met, an in-memory, compacting, time series, distributed database purpose built to power the Oban Web dashboard. Come and see what is possible with the spectactular combination of LiveView, Oban, and OTP.


**Key Takeaways:**
How to structure a complex LiveView application designed for high-performance queries in unpredictable environments, all backed by an in-memory, distributed time series database.

**Target Audience:**
Intermediate to advanced Elixirists interested in real-world LiveView applications, time series databases, distributed systems, and perhaps even Oban.
