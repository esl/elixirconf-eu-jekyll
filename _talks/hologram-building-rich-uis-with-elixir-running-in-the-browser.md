title: "Hologram: Building Rich UIs With Elixir Running in the Browser"
speakers: - _participants/bart-blast.md

---
Building rich, interactive UIs in pure Elixir is now possible with Hologram - a full-stack isomorphic web framework. By automatically transpiling Elixir to JavaScript, Hologram enables Elixir code to run directly in the browser while keeping the state on the client side.

This talk demonstrates how Hologram analyzes code to determine what should run on the client vs server, transforms Elixir into JavaScript, and manages client-side state. Practical examples will showcase building interactive UIs without writing JavaScript, and illustrate how this approach leads to better performance, enhanced offline capabilities, and reduced server load.

**Key Takeaways:**
1. Understanding Hologram's Core Innovation
- HowElixir code getsautomatically transpiled to runin the browser
- Why client-side state management leadsto better performance and offline capabilities

2. Building UIs Without JavaScript
- Howto create interactive web interfacesusing only Elixir
- Practical patterns for handling user interactions and state updates

3. Real-World Benefits
- Reduced server costs and improved scalability
- Howit simplifies full-stackElixir development

**Target Audience:**
- The presentation will be valuable for Phoenix developers looking to simplify their frontend stack and Elixir enthusiasts interested in client-side possibilities, showing a new way to build modern web applications in pure Elixir.
