In the moment a web application is available in internet, there is somebody that tries to break it. We can not avoid this but we can be prepared for it.

Web applications security is a deep subject. Our web applications are installed on servers, live in different environments, connect to database, use external APIs, etc.

This talk is about how to write secure web applications. We will not talk about servers, deployment and external dependencies. We will talk about code.

If you want to learn what are the common vulnerabilities a web application is exposed to and how the code we write can be prepared to handle them, this talk is for you.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Short review of the vulnerabilites and how to take them into account while writing the code.

**Target Audience:**
- Developers who start working on web applications or seasoned web applications developers who want to refresh their knowledge
