Last year at ElixirConf EU 2025, we briefly introduced AtomVM and the new horizons on the web with Popcorn.
This year, we'll go deeper into the hardware world, discovering how Elixir can be used for physical computing, even on inexpensive, resource-constrained microcontrollers.

This talk will go beyond the introduction, with a hands-on approach to using AtomVM to build a real project, using the Elixir tools and workflow available today.

**Key Takeaways:**

- What AtomVM is (super-brief refresher)
- What's new in AtomVM since last year
- How to build an IoT project with Elixir
- How to interact with the physical world
- Inspiration for what you can build, and maybe your next project.

**Target Audience:**

- Anyone who writes Elixir and is curious about hardware. No embedded experience required.
