<p>This talk is not only about building the game Minesweeper from scratch but also to make coding with Elixir a fun experience.
 <br /> <br />
 For a newbie, functional programming can get quite challenging. So, to make things enjoyable, Madhushree will use Phoenix LiveView and build a game in under 40 minutes.  <br /> <br />Madhushree will also talk about the difficulties she encountered while adopting Elixir, how she overcame them, utilising various resources and where to look for some tips and tricks.</p>
