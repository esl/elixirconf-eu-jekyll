<p>This talk is not only about building the game Minesweeper from scratch but also to make coding with Elixir a fun experience.
 
 For a newbie, functional programming can get quite challenging. So, to make things enjoyable, I will use Phoenix LiveView interestingly and build a game in under 40 minutes. I will also talk about the difficulties I encountered while adopting Elixir, how I overcame it utilising various resources and talk about where to look for some tips and tricks.</p>
