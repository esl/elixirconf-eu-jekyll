key_takeaways: " - The goal is to inspire people to build with Elixir, by giving an update about my journey building Liveroom, a project I announced during my talk at ElixirConf EU 2023. It is a great showcase of what is possible with LiveView & LiveState when building interactive experiences on the web."

LiveView is a great choice to build real-time web applications. But what happens when you don't control the stack of the website?
LiveState comes in to help bridge the gap, be it a Chrome extension or a custom HTML Element, to bring end-to-end real-time interactivity.
This is a showcase of the stack used by Liveroom (liveroom.app), the tool I'm building.
