<p>Mint is a young HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 client for Elixir that aims at disrupting the status quo of HTTP clients for Erlang and Elixir. Mint is built on the idea of having a functional, data-centric client that is not backed up by a process and doesn't impose a process architecture on its users. <br /><br />In this talk, we'll discuss the ideas behind Mint's design and get a feel for how Mint works. We'll spend some time exploring how the low-level interface that Mint provides lets us build different abstractions on top of it that are suited for different situations. We'll see the future of Mint and what abstractions it will enable.</p>
