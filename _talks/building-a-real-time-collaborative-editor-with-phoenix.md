Building a real-time collaborative experience like in Google Docs may sound daunting, but Elixir and Phoenix make it easy! This talk will walk you through the building blocks including OTP, Phoenix PubSub, and Operational Transform to build your own coauthoring service. We'll also discuss reliability and scaling through with our real-world experiences building this in Slab.
