Req is a batteries-included HTTP client for Elixir. One of the most common use case for an HTTP client is integrating 3rd party APIs and this talk will show how Req fits in that role. We will go from a proof-of-concept to a production-ready client with a focus on extensibility, performance, resilience, and observability. We will also discuss Req features for testing.
