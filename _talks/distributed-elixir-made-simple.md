Erlang/Elixir comes with a super power, the ability to transparently talk to either local or remote processes. Distributed software is often seen as complex and scary, but there's a sweet spot of low complexity, low risk use cases for distributed Elixir. This talk will aim to walk you through everything you need to start harnessing this super power in your own applications.

**Key Takeaways:**
- You will learn how to connect nodes, to handle deployments, and to build sufficiently reliable software on top of disterl, or distributed elixir.

**Target Audience:**
- Anyone interested in GenServers and distributed Elixir
