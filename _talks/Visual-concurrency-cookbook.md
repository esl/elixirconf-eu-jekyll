<p>While building an air travel distribution system, the number and variety of concurrency patterns we need to evaluate and apply can be vast. Sometimes OTP comes to the rescue, sometimes good tricks from the community, sometimes our own designs. I have been prototyping visualisation tools for the BEAM for few years already, also gave same talks around the topic. This time I would like to use these tools to tell our journey and present our learnings through a visual concurrency cookbook.</p>
