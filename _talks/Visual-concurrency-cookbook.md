While building an air travel distribution system, the number and variety of concurrency patterns we need to evaluate and apply can be vast. Sometimes OTP comes to the rescue, sometimes good tricks from the community, sometimes our own designs. 

Dániel has been prototyping visualisation tools for the BEAM for a few years already, he has also given some talks around the topic. This time, Dániel would like to use these tools to tell their journey and present their learnings through a visual concurrency cookbook.
