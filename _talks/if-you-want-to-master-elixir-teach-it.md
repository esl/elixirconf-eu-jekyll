This presentation is about explaining the core concepts of elixir (functional, immutability, pattern matching, pipelines, concurrency) in a simple way through examples and sharing the resources that helped her. Ana Maria is an advocate for diversity and inclusion for women and underrepresented groups in tech and she believes that knowledge sharing, mentoring and teaching is one of the best ways to growth as an engineer, develop leadership skills and promote more inclusion and diversity within the industry.
