This presentation is about explaining the core concepts of elixir (functional?, immutability, pattern matching, pipelines, concurrency) in a simple way through examples and sharing the resources that helped me. I am an advocate for diversity and inclusion for women and underrepresented groups in tech and I believe that knowledge sharing, mentoring and teaching is one of the best ways to growth as an engineer, develop leadership skills and promote more inclusion and diversity within the industry.
