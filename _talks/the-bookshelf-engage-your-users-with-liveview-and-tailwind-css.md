When you create a new Phoenix project, it comes with a lot of tools that we get for free. One of those is Tailwind CSS. Someone is not so subtly suggesting that this is a great CSS framework to use specifically with Phoenix.

But, what is Tailwind CSS? Why does it lend itself so well to working with Phoenix? How can you get started and make the most of the framework?

Together we will tackle all of these questions by building a simple application that includes a table using only what we get for free. Then we will uncover how well Tailwind is suited for LiveView by incorporating some best practices around componentization. We will bring our application to the next level to improve the user experience using more advanced Tailwind properties including arbitrary values, custom variables, and plugins. Through this exercise you will develop a solid understanding about Tailwind and how to use it effectively with LiveView to create captivating user interfaces.
