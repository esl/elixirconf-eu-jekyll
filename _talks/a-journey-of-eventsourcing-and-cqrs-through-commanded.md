Eventsourcing can be difficult, modeling such systems requires new ways of thinking to make sure things don't go wrong.

In this talk we will explore some of its history, what are in my opinion the three pillars of event-sourced systems and their substituent parts, and then we will explore the Commanded library to see how we can model and apply these concepts in elixir. Finally, we'll go through some real-world examples of how commanded works in action.
