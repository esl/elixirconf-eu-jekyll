I would like to share my experience working on event-sourced systems.

In particular, I am thinking of starting with the general concepts to domain-driven/event-sourced applications and CQRS. Later using a model of a pet project called MicroWords explore how to use event-sourcing for a content sharing platform using commanded and how the aforementioned concepts apply in the real world. Along the way, I would like to talk about gotchas and things to watch out for while considering/planning an event-sourced application.
