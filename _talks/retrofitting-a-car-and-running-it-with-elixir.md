Extending a cars' lifespan is not an easy feat. We need to ask ourselves what makes people enjoy a car today and what technology it should include. This talk shares the current state of our journey in retrofitting a car and building a new and open vehicle control system (OVCS), redesigning the engine controller and infotainment systems with off the shelve components running with Elixir.

We will explain how we reverse-engineered the proprietary CAN bus messages from the car, how we created our own raspberry pi CAN bus hats and how we used nerves to create firmware for the new electric engine controller and infotainment systems.
