In this talk I explore how you can author generic interfaces in Elixir, and then with the help of macros and reflection, dynamically expose those interfaces to LLMs. That's right, we'll be learning how to hand over the keys to your computational castle to a non-deterministic, unconscious text generation machine!!!

I'll dive into topics like:
- How doc and moduledoc comments work, and how to interact with them at compile time
- How LLMs "know" how to call functions
- How to interact with LLMs via the abstraction of message chains using the Langchain Elixir library

**Key Takeaways:**
- How doc and moduledoc comments work, and how to interact with them at compile time
- How LLMs "know" how to call functions
- How to interact with LLMs via the abstraction of message chains using the Langchain Elixir library

**Target Audience:**
- Intermediate Elixir programmers interested in the possibilities of compile-time metaprogramming or even just interested in how Large Language Model interactions are structured in applications.
