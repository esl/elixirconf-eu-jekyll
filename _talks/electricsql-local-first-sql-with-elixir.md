Local-first is a new paradigm for developing apps, where you code against an embedded database in the client and have reactive, realtime, multi-user sync in the background.

[ElectricSQL](https://electric-sql.com) is a new, open-source, platform for local-first development that works with standard Postgres and SQLite. This talk introduces the ElectricSQL system and dives into its core replication technology, developed in Elixir.

**Talk objectives:**
1. To introduce the ElectricSQL system and the local-first software development paradigm.
2. To illustrate how Elixir is/can be used to develop a cutting edge new distributed database platform.

**Target audience:**
* Generalist developers (backend, frontend and full stack). 
* Distributed systems engineers.
