Wouldn't it be great if you could use the same familiar mix commands to create, publish, and consume libraries and documentation privately within your company as you do when working on personal projects? In this talk, I'll demonstrate how self-hosting your own package repository, documentation, and livebook instance can create an intuitive internal elixir ecosystem your engineers will feel right at home using.

**Talk objectives:**

* I hope attendees can learn that they can host their own package repository, ExDocs documentation site, and livebook service internally, and create custom mix tasks to handle all the necessary internal boilerplate. And that by stitching together these excellent tools they can improve the way engineers discover and share elixir code inside their company.

**Target audience:**

* Engineers of all levels looking to improve the internal elixir tooling at their company.
