talk: Using Elixir for scheduling cloud-native DAG workflows
audience: Intermediate
---
<p>Current state-of-art DAG workflow schedulers (AirFlow, Luigi) do not seem to leverage power of on-demand cloud computing instances. We used Elixir distributed capabilities to write a powerful yet simple scheduler that is used in production for our data processing pipeline. Among others, I will talk about challenges, various approaches to running external processes in Elixir, monitoring and displaying progress UI in LiveView and testing.</p>
