Membrane Framework is an Elixir-based framework for multimedia processing & streaming. Previously it was serving relatively niche use cases but with the recent addition of WebRTC, it now allows having many new types of applications. Elixir can be now used to send, receive and process audio & video streams to and from a web browser and mobile applications. If you ever thought about embedding video conference or webinars within your application, now you can learn how to achieve this with Elixir.
