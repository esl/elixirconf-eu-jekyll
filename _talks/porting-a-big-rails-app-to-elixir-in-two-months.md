speakers:
- _participants/miguel-michelson.md

---
As a way of learning Elixir I've ported my 3-year rails development of my [open-source platform](https://github.com/chaskiq/chaskiq "open-source platform"). This talk will present the steps on how to do it. And what aspects to consider when doing it.

Talk objectives:

* Present some aspects and tips when entering the elixir world when coming from rails land. I will show how nice Elixir is and how rails devs could overcome their fears to let activerecord and their awesome gems go.

Target audience:

* Those rails devs who are not sure to migrate or enter Elixir
* Elixir starters
