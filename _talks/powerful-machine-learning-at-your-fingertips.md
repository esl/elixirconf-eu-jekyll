Two years ago Nx laid the foundation for efficient numerical computation in Elixir. Soon followed Axon bringing the building blocks for training and running Neural Networks. At this talk we will focus on a new part of the story - Bumblebee - and we will see how using powerful models is just a few lines of code (or clicks) away.

**Talk objectives:**
* Show how the Elixir community is building a streamlined Machine Learning experience and lowering the barrier to get from idea to deployment.
* Also, to get you excited about a new category of applications and the future.

**Target audience:**
* Anyone interested in the capabilities offered by Machine Learning.
