Simple Network Monitoring Protocol, one of the oldest internet applications, is particularly suited for monitoring low-resource devices. While integrated into OTP since the early days, the complexity of the SNMP framework makes it notoriously challenging to use compared to HTTP, MQTT and others. In this talk, we will present how to bring SNMP to your Nerves device leveraging existing OTP and some elixir meta-programming magic. The code used in the talk has been conveniently wrapped into the elixir-library to make it easy for you.

**Talk objectives:**

* This talk aims at providing Nerves developers with hints for integrating SNMP into their application.

**Target audience:**

* Nerves developers
