In this talk we share our experiences of introducing Elixir at a major Swiss insurance company.

Helvetia recently adopted Elixir to replace several complex Jenkins pipelines that powered a Git-Ops based self-service for governance, provisioning and configuration of our Kafka streaming platform.

The initial success opened the possibility to implement further self-services with similar features for our API platform as well as supporting services in Elixir.

During this talk we try to answer the following questions:

* Why did we choose Elixir for this journey and why not something else?
* Why did we not stay with technologies already established in the organization?
* How did the organization see the benefit of adopting Elixir as the best fit for this domain?
* How did the organization get amazed by the power of Elixir?

**Target audience:**

* Software engineers in corporate jobs who want to bring Elixir on the table * Project/product managers
* Dev Ops engineers
* Everyone else curious about using Elixir in an enterprise setting
