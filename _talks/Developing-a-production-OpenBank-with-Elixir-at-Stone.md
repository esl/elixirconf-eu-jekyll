This is more in the line of other talks of how one can grow a team in a language that has obvious advantages but not a full crowd of developers looking for jobs. There are many angles that can be approached here: the organization of a team, growth-hacking, technical difficulties and lessons learned. I am more inclined to focus on the technical side of things, for example, how and why we moved away from Commanded, patterns that became used in many places, telemetry and so on. Though I fear that most of them wouldn't be specific to Elixir or the BEAM and be more likely to please people trying to grow any system.
