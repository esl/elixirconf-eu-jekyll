This talk is a recollection of challenges we had while bringing up an Open Bank API from zero with Elixir at Stone. Although the ecosystem is quite mature, integrating with very old systems that have non-standard practices brought us some common problems. Also, for a team new to the BEAM at first, there were other challenges like deployment practices, architectural choices, BEAM culture in general, human resources and so on. It all pays off in the end for us and we hope this sharing of experience might help others decide to participate in the ecosystem.
