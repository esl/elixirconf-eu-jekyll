Building a framework is an exciting, but also challenging job. Our team knows that well after years of development of Membrane, and the upcoming core 1.0 release is an excellent opportunity to talk about what we learned. Organising work, choosing tradeoffs and priorities, creating abstractions, organising code, designing API, going open source - these challenges must be tackled in various projects. Still, when creating a framework they sometimes show up in an unusual way. In this talk, I'll discuss some of them taking Membrane as an example.

**Talk objectives:**
* Learn the process of creating a framework in Elixir.
* Learn what are the challenges there and how they can be approached.
