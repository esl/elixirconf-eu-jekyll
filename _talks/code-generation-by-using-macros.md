Creating a code generator often involves managing static strings and interpolation, resulting in a complex and fairly unreadable code. However, Elixir provides a variety of tools that simplify this task significantly!

In this session, we'll explore the capabilities of the Macro module, showcasing how it facilitates effortless code generation. Additionally, we'll present a practical demonstration using openapi_codegen to illustrate the substantial advantages it offers to both developers and maintainers.

By delving into these tools and practical examples, you'll gain insights into leveraging Elixir's functionalities for seamless code generation, demonstrating how it can significantly enhance the development experience for you and the maintainers of your projects.
