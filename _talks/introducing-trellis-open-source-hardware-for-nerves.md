This talk will discuss the ongoing development of Trellis, a fully open-source hardware platform built for Nerves. Think of it as an open-source Raspberry Pi, but designed to be easily adapted to produce your own custom circuit boards for Nerves and Elixir. We’ll discuss the benefits of building custom hardware for your products, and how open source unlocks even faster rapid prototyping for Nerves and Elixir in embedded device development.

**Key Takeaways:**

The following is the general outline/key takeaways of the talk:
- Short introduction to Nerves
- Types of hardware projects - microcontrollers vs HAT vs SBC, where Nerves fits in
- Introduction of Trellis, features and capabilities of the platform
- A deeper look at the T113-S3 CPU
- How open hardware opens up new possibilities and form factors, reducing product development time

**Target Audience:**
- Individuals and teams who are currently using Nerves, as well as anyone who either wants to learn more about Nerves, hardware development, or exciting hardware projects in the Nerves ecosystem.
