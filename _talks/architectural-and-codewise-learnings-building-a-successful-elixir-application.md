level:
- Intermediate
tags:
- show-me-the-code
audience: "- Beginner Elixir Engineers who want to learn standard techniques to make their code concise and uniform.\n
- More experienced Elixir engineers who want to see, learn and discuss different approaches to solve common problems in different applications."
format: In-person
title: "Architectural and Codewise Learnings Building a Successful Elixir Application"
speakers:
- _participants/fernando-hamasaki-de-amorim.md
key_takeaways: "The idea is that during the talk the attendees have at least one moment like:\n
- 'Ah, that is interesting to try…'\n
- 'We are doing the same/similar in our application and it works very well…'\n
- 'Why is he doing that?! I have a much better solution for the same problem.'\n
I hope those kinds of moments above generate discussions and exchange of ideas and experiences after the talk between the attendees."

After more than 4 years running a successful Elixir application built from scratch, there are a lot of learnings, gotchas, challenges, and good and painful parts along the way.

You will see examples of real code showing how Elixir can be pure love, as well as solutions for simple recurring problems (that sometimes are not so simple) and complex common scenarios.

Furthermore, see practical techniques, coding standards and guidelines that can make your Elixir code uniform, more readable and easier to maintain.
