Is Elixir great for writing games? I'm not too sure about the client side, but for game servers, I think it's a swell choice.

I'm familiar with game servers. I built an MMORPG server at a game platform startup I co-founded (in Java) and ran the tech groups for games at Nickelodeon, including an MMORPG for kids and Neopets.

In this talk, we'll start with a simple single-player roguelike running in LiveView. Then, through a series of code reviews and live merges, we'll turn it into a multiplayer game. You'll get to connect and, who knows, perhaps even defeat the BBEG!

You'll leave understanding why the actor model makes "add more players" straightforward - no promises, no mutexes, just processes talking to each other.

Bring your phone. You're part of the demo.

Ellyse speaks about programming languages, distributed systems, and making complex things tangible. She's based in Paris and can sometimes be found doing real work instead of having fun.

**Key Takeaways:**

- elixir is great for real time game state, scaling, and failure case. so much easier to program than dealing with mutex here. mob ai is good too, easy to write code to control mobs.

**Target Audience:**

- elixir devs who also like to game or interested in game programming
