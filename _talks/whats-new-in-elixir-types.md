A quick tour of recent updates to Elixir's type system and what's coming next. I'll show what's working with pattern analysis and type tracking, what's on the horizon with typed structs and guard analysis, and the interesting problems we're solving along the way, such as how to present set-theoretic types to the user.

**Target Audience:**
- Elixir developers
