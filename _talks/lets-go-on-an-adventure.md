Join me as we bravely set forth to learn how our everyday web development toolset can power a collaborative, multi-modal video game. This session will be a journey of discovery as we explore using Elixir, OTP, and Phoenix to power an adventure game in which multiple players work together to create an exciting interactive experience.

After a brief overview of our game design goals, we’ll see how common Elixir libraries and paradigms elegantly solve a number of game development challenges—and reveal interesting new opportunities!

We’ll cover leveraging LiveView to power clever small-screen interfaces, see how integrating Phoenix Channels with an off-the-shelf game engine can bring a world to life with ease, and more—with plenty of practical examples and demos along the way.

You’ll walk away excited to embark upon your own Elixir game development adventure!
