This session will outline how to build terminal UIs (TUI) for Elixir, and go into depth about the author's Termite library, and the story behind its development. It will also go into detail on how the terminal works in general, covering ANSI sequences, and terminal input and output.

There will also be some discussion on the other libraries that build on top of Termite to provide developers with a familiar approach to building applications. 

**Key Takeaways:**
- The audience should be made aware why the Termite library is a necessary addition to the ecosystem when building terminal UIs. The audience should also leave with an idea for how they can get started.

**Target Audience:**
- Anyone interested in building TUIs with Elixir. It should appeal to beginners and intermediate alike.
