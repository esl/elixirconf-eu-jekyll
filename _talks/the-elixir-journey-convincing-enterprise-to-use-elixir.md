As SaltPay started to grow and look more enterprise people were concerned about Elixir. There was a fear of emerging technologies. With some teamwork, commitment and effort we managed to convince people. In this talk, Iâ€™ll go through the main points higher management raised about Elixir and how we started addressing them and how we got to even became good examples of how to organize development communities inside the company.

**Talk objectives:**

* make people believe they can have management buy-in to use emerging technologies (with some practical things people can do for that)
* convince those that are in a position to make decisions that sometimes the risk is worth it.

**Target audience:**

* Anyone, but mainly people that are trying to become advocates in bigger companies (or companies growing fast) and are facing resistance.
