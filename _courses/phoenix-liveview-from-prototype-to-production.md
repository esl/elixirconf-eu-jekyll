summary: In this training, we’ll evaluate which sorts of features are the best fit for what LiveView can offer, then build out an interactive real-time UI to get a feel for how LiveView works. We’ll then look at integrating LiveView into an existing Phoenix application, address performance considerations and failover strategies, and look at examples of how to test and monitor a LiveView feature in a real-world application.
description: Phoenix LiveView is a powerful new tool that combines the development efficiency of server-side rendering with the rich, interactive experiences that users have come to expect in web applications. Building on the capabilities of Phoenix Channels and the BEAM’s strong primitives for availability and fault tolerance, LiveView lets us deliver rich user interfaces without the overhead of building a full client-side application.
