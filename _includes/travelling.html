          <p>
            For the first time ElixirConf will be in the United Kingdom, welcoming everybody from around the world to one of the most culturally diverse cities in Europe.<br><br>

            The UK is one of the most highly vaccinated countries in the world and the NHS has declared that the UK is now past the peak of the latest Omicron variant.
            Due to this downward trend the UK government has recently eased restrictions for entry from most countries.
            From 18 March, all COVID-19 travel restrictions will be lifted, including the passenger locator form (PLF) for arrivals into the UK, as well as all tests for passengers who do not qualify as vaccinated. This change, therefore, removes the need for unvaccinated passengers to take a pre-departure test and a "Day 2" post-arrival test.<br><br>
