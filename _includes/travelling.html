          <p>
            For the first time ElixirConf will be in the United Kingdom, welcoming everybody from around the world to one of the most culturally diverse cities in Europe.<br><br>

            The UK is one of the most highly vaccinated countries in the world and the NHS has declared that the UK is now past the peak of the latest Omicron variant.
            Due to this downward trend the UK government has recently eased restrictions for entry from most countries and will now only require vaccinated visitors to book and take a lateral flow test.
            From 4:00 AM GMT on February the 11th, 2022, incoming passengers from most countries will not be required to test to enter the UK. They will only be required to fill out their passenger locator form before arriving.<br><br>
