             <p class="text-content mb-2">
               <strong>For nearly a decade, ElixirConf EU has been the must-attend Elixir event in Europe. Every year, hundreds of developers with a passion for Elixir come together to learn about, share and inspire the progression of the Elixir ecosystem.
Our events frequently include members of the core teams of Elixir’s biggest frameworks and are a hub for the announcement of new features and developments. Whether you’re new to Elixir or a seasoned Elixir developer there is something for everyone at ElixirConf EU. From in-depth Elixir training for all skill levels to immersive keynotes that bring you to the forefront of Elixir development, we are actively championing the continued growth of the Elixir community.
Last year we reached over 500+ attendees so to ensure we are spreading Elixir to as wide an audience as possible, this year's event will again be run as a hybrid event, which means you can participate either online or in person in Lisbon.<br><br>
