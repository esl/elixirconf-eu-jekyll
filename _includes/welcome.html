             <p class="text-content mb-2">
               <strong>Every year, hundreds of developers with a passion for Elixir come together to learn about, share and inspire the progression of the Elixir ecosystem.<br>
Our events frequently include members of the core teams of Elixir’s biggest frameworks and are a hub for the announcement of new features and developments. Whether you’re new to Elixir or a seasoned Elixir developer there is something for everyone at ElixirConf EU. From in-depth Elixir training for all skill levels to immersive keynotes that bring you to the forefront of Elixir development, we are actively championing the continued growth of the Elixir community.
<strong>In 2023, we reached over 800 attendees so to ensure we are spreading Elixir to as wide an audience as possible, 2024 event will again be run as a hybrid event, which means you can participate either in person in Lisbon or online.</strong><br><br>
