               <strong>[UPDATE] To keep ElixirConf EU accessible, safe and enjoyable for as many people as possible,
               we have decided to move the date of the conference from April to the 9-10 June 2022.</strong><br><br>

               For nearly a decade, ElixirConf EU has been the must attend Elixir event in Europe.
               Every year, hundreds of developers with a passion for Elixir come together to learn about,
               share and inspire the progression of the Elixir ecosystem. <br><br>

               Our events frequently include members of the core teams of Elixir’s biggest frameworks
               as well as being a hub for the announcement of new features and developments.
               Whether you’re new to Elixir or a seasoned Elixir developer there is something for everyone at ElixirConf.
               From in-depth Elixir training for all skill levels to immersive keynotes that bring you
               to the forefront of Elixir development, we are actively championing the continued growth of the Elixir community. <br><br>

              This year ElixirConf EU is going HYBRID. This means you can participate in the conference either online or in person in London.
