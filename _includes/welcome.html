            <p class="text-content mb-2">
                The conference is a melting pot for new ideas and inspired thinking.<br/>
                It showcases the great work being done with Elixir by individuals and companies alike.
                <br/>
                It helps those new to the community find their feet, and welcomes back those who have attended before, to champion and progress the uptake and development of Elixir in Europe. In June, we welcomed over 400 Elixir users from around the world to our first virtual ElixirConf EU event, and this time, we want to make it even bigger! <br/>
              	More information about the virtual event will be available soon. Let’s stay connected! <br/>
