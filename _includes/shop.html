        <p>For the second time we have created ElixrConf EU e-shop with conference swag!
          <br><br>Now you can not only participate in our ElixirConf 2022 hybrid experience, but also order t-shirts (included in the in-person ticket!), sweatshirts, mugs and many more items from the comfort of your couch.
          <br><br>All items are ordered directly with Spreadshirt but are branded with the official ElixirConf EU designs. The store was created for our community but is a third party supplier. Any issues with the items should be directed to the supplier and not Code Sync.
