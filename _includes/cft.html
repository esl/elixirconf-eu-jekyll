            <li>
                Deep dives into
                <strong>Phoenix Contexts and Boundaries</strong>, strategies for
                <strong>managing application state</strong> using PubSub,
                Registry, and integrating OTP patterns (GenServers) within the
                Phoenix structure.

            <li>
                <strong>High-Performance Phoenix</strong>: Talks on optimizing
                endpoint performance, efficient data serialization, minimizing
                latency between client and server, and leveraging new BEAM
                features for speed and reduced latency in I/O bound tasks
                specifically within a Phoenix application
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Testing and Maintenance</strong>: strategies for
                <strong>Ecto testing</strong>, comprehensive LiveView testing
                patterns, using property-based testing, and ensuring long-term
                maintainability in large, evolving Phoenix codebases.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Advanced LiveView Architectures</strong>: Beyond the
                basics - showcasing large-scale LiveView applications, patterns
                for <strong>complex component design</strong> (including new
                features and Hooks), and techniques for optimizing the
                browser-server communication layer. We are particularly
                interested in <strong>JavaScript interop</strong> best practices
                and <strong>Elixir in the browser</strong> (e.g.,
                <strong>Hologram, Popcorn</strong>),
                <strong>Rust Interop</strong>.
