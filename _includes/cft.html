        <p class="text-content mb-2" align="left" style="color: white">
            Do you have knowledge or experience with Elixir and its rapidly
            evolving ecosystem? We're seeking speakers focused on the areas
            where **Elixir and high-impact application development** truly
            shine, exploring advanced techniques, real-world scaling challenges,
            and the integration of emerging technologies. We seek talks that are
            technically deep, practical, and heavily oriented toward building
            **robust, maintainable, and highly concurrent, distributed
            systems**.
            <br />
            Submit your talk proposal by <strong> 6 January</strong>.

            Need talk ideas? We're looking for advanced content across these
            core areas:
            <li>
                <strong>Core Phoenix & Application Architecture:</strong> Deep
                dives into **Phoenix Contexts and Boundaries**, advanced
                strategies for **managing application state** using PubSub,
                Registry, and integrating OTP patterns (GenServers) within the
                Phoenix structure. **High-Performance Phoenix**: Talks on
                optimizing endpoint performance, efficient data serialization,
                minimizing latency between client and server, and leveraging new
                BEAM features for speed and reduced latency in I/O bound tasks
                specifically within a Phoenix application. **Testing and
                Maintenance**: Advanced strategies for **Ecto testing**,
                comprehensive **LiveView testing patterns**, using
                property-based testing, and ensuring long-term maintainability
                in large, evolving Phoenix codebases.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>AI & Data Landscape:</strong>
                **Advanced LiveView Architectures**: Beyond the basics -
                showcasing large-scale LiveView applications, patterns for
                **complex component design** (including new features and Hooks),
                and advanced techniques for optimizing the browser-server
                communication layer. We are particularly interested in
                **JavaScript interop** best practices and **Elixir in the
                browser** (e.g., Hologram, Popcorn), Rust Interop. **Elixir in
                GenAI & Machine Learning**: Practical applications leveraging
                **Nx** for scientific computing, integrating AI/ML models
                directly into BEAM applications, processing **real-time data
                streams** for large language models (LLMs), and exploring
                **local AI inference** and whisper integration as application
                features. **Data & Streaming Pipelines with Ecto/Oban**: Using
                **Broadway**, **Flow**, and **Oban** to handle massive data
                processing, event sourcing, and high-throughput background job
                execution, with a strong focus on **robust data persistence and
                transactional integrity via Ecto**.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Ecosystem, Operations, and Future Trends:</strong>
                **Real-World Case Studies & ROI**: Compelling stories from
                companies that have successfully scaled with Phoenix, detailing
                the business value, **Return on Investment (ROI)**, and lessons
                learned from migrating legacy systems to the Phoenix stack,
                including use cases for **Nerves** (IoT, embedded systems).
                **Modern DevOps & Observability**: Best practices for deploying
                Elixir/Phoenix applications in Cloud Native environments
                (Kubernetes, Nomad), advanced **Telemetry** and tracing, and
                innovative tooling for **profiling and monitoring** in
                production. **Community & Developer Experience**: Insights into
                improving the **Elixir Developer Experience (DX)**, effective
                team onboarding, fostering open-source contributions, and the
                future evolution of the language design.
