          <hr/>
          <p>Your safety and the safety of others is of the utmost importance to us as organisers and ILEC Conference Centre.
            <br/><br/>All attendees must present <b>one</b> of the following:<br/>
          </p>
          <br/>
            <ul class="text-content">
              <li>A negative COVID test dated no more than 72 hours prior to the conference (both quick test and PCR test are accepted)</li>
              <li>Proof of vaccination (either in writing, on a card, or a digital certificate in an app)</li>
            </ul>
          <br/>
          <p>We will also ask you to sign a waiver form signed a day prior to the conference via conference app or signed on paper on the day of the conference.
            <br/><br/>Do not attend if you or anyone you have been in contact with has shown any symptoms of COVID 72 hours prior.
          </p>
