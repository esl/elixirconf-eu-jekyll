<p>Justin is in a constant state of wanting to make the world around him bend to his imagination. At one time he wondered how hard it would be to start his motorcycle from his phone. Rewiring the motorcycle and writing an interface was easy, but connecting it all together proved to be a challenge. A challenge that would define his career. That invisible, often impenetrable layer in the air between all the hardware in the world has become his stomping ground. Hardware is hard, so he's been working on nerves to make it easy.</p>
