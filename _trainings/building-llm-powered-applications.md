Learn both applied and theoretical knowledge on working with LLMs. In this training session we will build an end-to-end application powered by LLMs. We will start with a simple interface to accept user prompts and then we will equip it with various abilities such as: interaction with our running application, extraction of free-form text into data structures, recognizing user intent, and finally a research agent that will help us make informed decisions. This will be done in three session each starting with a brief theoretical introduction and then a deep dive to build desired features.

**Training Objectives:**
This packed class will teach you both theoretical and practical aspects of working with LLMs in Elixir applications.

### Theory

* What are LLMs and how do they work
* Embeddings and semantic token representations
* Tools and MCPs
* Context & Prompt Engineering
* LLM Agents
* The core building blocks of Agentic Applications
* Evaluation and why it is essential for scaling LLM powered apps

### Practice

* Basic chat interface with streaming
* Receiving user commands
* Adding our first tool to the LLM
* Recognizing user intent to make informed decisions
* Allowing our LLM agent to interact with our application
* Extracting data from free-form text or websites
* Creating a research agent
* Basic evaluation system for our data extraction workflow and research agent

**Training prerequisites:**
* A laptop with elixir and postgres. Basic knowledge of Elixir/Phoenix is a plus.
