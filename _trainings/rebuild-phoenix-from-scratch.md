The training will be a mix of both theory and hands-on exercise where the participants will recreate a mini-version of Phoenix from scratch.

As we build our mini-Phoenix, we will see how Phoenix uses a very thin layer of Elixir macros for much of the magic it does. As we see through this layer of Elixir macros, we will see how the functional nature of phoenix is very simple and yet powerful with several aha moments throughout the session to make you a confident developer who knows the Phoenix framework inside out.
