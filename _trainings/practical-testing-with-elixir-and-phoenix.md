title: "Practical testing with Elixir (and Phoenix)"
published: true

---
This tutorial teaches a practical testing approach which maximizes the value you can get out of your tests in real-life collaborative Elixir projects. You'll learn how to increase the confidence in your tests, organically maximize coverage, and improve the test clarity. This is going to be a very interactive and hands-on session involving a lot of coding and discussions. You'll be writing tests for a Phoenix-powered Elixir web server, so it is expected you are familiar with Elixir, Phoenix, and Ecto.

**OBJECTIVES:**
Get the most out of your tests with the least amount of the test code

**PREREQUISITES:**
Familiarity with Erlang, Elixir, Phoenix, and ExUnit. Attendees also need to bring a working machine with Erlang and Elixir installed, and an IDE of their choice.
