Are you an Elixir developer looking to build ambitious applications? Have you felt the pain of building large applications with a lack of consistency, tooling and extensibility? Do you hate spending time reinventing the wheel, when you could be crafting innovative solutions for your customers? Join us on a hands-on journey from beginner to expert using the Ash Framework to build an Elixir application in a way that change the way you think about building applications.

Starting with the basics, we model our domain with Ash resources. We cover the structure that Ash provides for your application and the basic building blocks that you will use. From there, we can start leveraging the power of Ash to build more complex parts of our applications.

(This will be a much more refined version of the training presented in ElixirConf Orlando)

**OBJECTIVES:**
- At the end of this course, youâ€™ll have built a non-trivial example application, as well as the tools and knowledge to build ambitious full stack applications with Ash. You'll know how Ash works and understand the ecosystem of tools to make building your Elixir applications with ease and spend less time reinventing the wheel and more time on the interesting problems.

**PREREQUISITES:**
- Basic Elixir skills, will need a laptop with Elixir, OTP, an Editor, Git and Postgres.
