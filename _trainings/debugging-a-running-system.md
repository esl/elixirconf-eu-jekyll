Start out with a buggy release and use tools to debug that running instance.

In this training, we'll start out with a single app and show how you can identify and fix bottlenecks in a running system. You'll learn how to make a release and then debug it.

Once we've instrumented a single node release, we'll move to a multi-node release instrument with distributed traces and then resolve the issues.

In the latter half of the training, we'll simulate a multi-node app and show how we can use distributed traces to identify bottlenecks and resolve them.

By the training's end, you should have tools and strategies to identify and resolve production issues.
