This tutorial explores the practical aspects of implementing and testing horizontally scalable distributed applications using Elixir with Riak Core Lite.

Highly-available and scalable systems distribute and replicate data across physically distinct nodes to provide high throughput and fault-tolerance.

While introducing concurrency enables better performance, it requires careful reasoning about consistency of data and computational state to prevent data corruption or loss.

Systems often use techniques like consistent hashing, reader/writer quorums, data versioning and anti-entropy to keep systems consistent and functional, though the tradeoff is additional complexity.

Riak Core Lite is a framework that simplifies the development of dynamo-style architectures, such as highly-available key-value stores, session storage, distributed computation and messaging systems.
