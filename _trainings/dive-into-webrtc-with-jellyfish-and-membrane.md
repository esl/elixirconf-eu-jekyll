In last few years, WebRTC became the technology that runs the world. Classes, stand-ups, conferences - everything can now became remote mainly thanks to this standard.  
During this training you’ll see how to use Elixir-based media server Jellyfish built on top of Membrane Framework to create your own WebRTC-enabled app.  
We’ll start with the short introduction to the WebRTC itself, then we’ll set-up a Jellyfish server and next we’ll explore the opportunities to extend its capabilities with Membrane pipelines.

* Learn the basics of WebRTC technology
* See Jellyfish in action
* Explore building a web app with real-time video communication
