Testing your application might seem simple at first, but there's more than meets the eye to writing a really great test suite. In this training, we'll quickly recap the basics of unit testing before moving on to some of the trickier tests that we might need to write.

We'll cover unit testing our GenServers, integration testing with Wallaby, and then finish up with stateless and stateful property-based testing with PropEr. You'll come away from this training prepared to test anything that might come your way!
