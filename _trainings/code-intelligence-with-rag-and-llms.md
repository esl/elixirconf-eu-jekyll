How to gain insights and intelligence about your codebase without training other people's LLM: Setup an Elixir-only RAG application that analyses your code, helps you with documentation and maintains your style:
- Intro: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Gen-AI on codebases.
- Setup: Pure Elixir RAG and Gen-Ai on your codebase
- Steps to set up, structure, and customize an open-source RAG system for various use cases.
- Lab: Methods for evaluating RAG system performance, including key metrics and optimization techniques.
- Insights into practical applications of RAG, including identifying use cases and spotting its implementation in real-world scenarios like Devon and Cursor

**OBJECTIVES:**
-  Setup of code intelligence on your codebase (pure local)
- Learn how to improve and measure RAG
- Security implications

**TARGET AUDIENCE:**
- Intermediate users
