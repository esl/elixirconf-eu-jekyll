Rethinking DevOps is about building bridges via more multi-disciplinary teams.
To praise this perception of the paradigm, we will build a umbrella project with
two main components: an Erlang backend and a Phoenix LiveView front-end.
Both components will be dockerised and deployed to a remote k8s cluster that
we will provision with Terraform. Ensuring a steady and tested delivery pipeline
with GitHub actions on the process.

Training objectives:

- Praise rethinking the DevOps paradigm

Target audience:

- Everyone, if you like technology, you should be interested in this

Training prerequisites:

- an Environment with erlang, elixir, kind, kubectl, terraform, skaffold installed
- a linode active account
