Most people think Phoenix and Ecto libraries do several magical things and perceive them as complex frameworks to use. Even if they do use them, they don't fully appreciate the simple and brilliant design behind it.

In this training we aim to understand how these simple data structures play vital roles in the design and internal working of Phoenix and Ecto.

The training will be a mix of both theory and hands on exercise where the participants will recreate a mini-version of Phoenix all from scratch and see through the magic of Elixir macros and functional composition nature of Phoenix and Ecto.
