# Want to Know More About LiveView?
We’ve got you covered. We’ve been singing from the LiveView hymn sheet for years now
and we’re pretty confident that you could become a LiveView evangelist too but first, here’s why we think it’s so great:

- First, LiveView is essentially an expansive library that lends itself to rich real-time user experiences with server-rendered HTML
- It offers a greatly simplified programming model when compared to JavaScript alternatives and LiveView-powered applications are stateful on the server with bidirectional communication through WebSockets
- LiveView singlehandedly transcended what developers thought of Elixir worldwide
- Finally, it set the path for moving Elixir from a server-side technology to the powerful full-stack ecosystem that it is today.

So without further ado here are some brilliant videos we’ve collected over the years from past ElixirConf events on Phoenix LiveView:

In January 2020 LiveView saw rapid growth and a ton of new features added which creator Chris McCord takes you through one by one in his update on LiveView.

In this next video, Chris McCord answers audience questions like ‘when you created Pheonix what was the problem you were trying to solve?’ and ‘where does surface fit in with the LiveView landscape?’ Check out the video for all his answers.

In this talk, Wiebe-Marten Wijnja explains and shares his experiences on how Elixir, Phoenix and LiveView can be used to create web applications in which multiple users are collaborating in real-time-like collaborative document editing and multiplayer games.

In this talk, Chris McCord walks you through how to take advantage of the many features and functions of Phoenix LiveView. He also explains why there is ‘no need to write Javascript’ with Phoenix LiveView.
