# Want to Know More About LiveView?
<br>
We’ve got you covered. We’ve been singing from the LiveView hymn sheet for years now
and we’re pretty confident that you could become a LiveView evangelist too but first, here’s why we think it’s so great:

- First, LiveView is essentially an expansive library that lends itself to rich real-time user experiences with server-rendered HTML
- It offers a greatly simplified programming model when compared to JavaScript alternatives and LiveView-powered applications are stateful on the server with bidirectional communication through WebSockets
- LiveView singlehandedly transcended what developers thought of Elixir worldwide
- Finally, it set the path for moving Elixir from a server-side technology to the powerful full-stack ecosystem that it is today.

So without further ado here are some brilliant videos we’ve collected over the years from past ElixirConf events on Phoenix LiveView:
