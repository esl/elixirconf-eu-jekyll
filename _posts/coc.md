**CODE OF CONDUCT**

ElixirConf EU is a community conference created to promote education, networking and
collaboration within the Elixir/Erlang/Ruby communities. We value the participation of
each member of the community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling
experience. Attendees are expected to act with decorum showing respect and acceptance to
other attendees throughout the conference, and at all conference events, whether
officially sponsored by ElixirConf or not. All delegates, speakers, exhibitors and
volunteers at ElixirConf are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct.
Organizers will implement this code throughout the event.

● Be honest
● Use respectful language and actions
● Be inclusive
● Respect culture and custom
● Consider your actions and act with integrity
● Use good judgment and avoid even the appearance of improper behaviour 
● Follow the law 
● Be accountable.

If ever in doubt about a course of conduct, ask yourself: Is it ethical? Is it legal? Will
it reflect well on me as well as ElixirConf? Would I want to read about it in the
newspaper or on the web? If the answer is “No” to any of these questions, don’t do it. We
want to thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.

**Legal Details**

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation,
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public
spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording,
sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact and
unwelcome sexual attention. Speakers, attendees, exhibitors, sponsors and vendors are
subject to the code of conduct. Speakers, sponsors and exhibitors should not use profane,
vulgar or sexual images, activities, or other material. Talks should be appropriate for
both a professional audience and a younger audience. Imagery and language (both written
and spoken), are to be free of profane, vulgar or sexual content. Participants asked to
stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages
in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, the conference organizers may take any
action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the
conference with no refund.
