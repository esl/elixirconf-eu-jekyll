# Why you should come to London for ElixirConf EU

London hosts one of the most engaging and varied tech communities in the world and you might be surprised to know that the UK also has a healthy, ever-expanding Elixir community. Some London-based companies whom you might not know that use Elixir include Duffel, Ably, Square Enix, British Broadcasting Corporation, SaltPay, V7, Vetspire and Nested.

In addition to our usual conference activities, we will also be hosting a **special party** to celebrate ten incredible years of Elixir. We hope to see you there!

With all that in mind, we are thrilled to be holding ElixirConf EU in London and we have a few tips and tricks for you to get the most out of your visit!
