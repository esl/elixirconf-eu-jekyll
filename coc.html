            <p>
                ElixirConf EU is a community conference created to promote
                education, networking and collaboration within the
                Elixir/Erlang/Ruby communities. We value the participation of
                each member of the community and want all attendees to have an
                enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Attendees are expected to
                act with decorum showing respect and acceptance to other
                attendees throughout the conference, and at all conference
                events, whether officially sponsored by ElixirConf or not. All
                delegates, speakers, exhibitors and volunteers at ElixirConf are
                required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers
                will implement this code throughout the event.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Be honest</li>
                <li>Use respectful language and actions</li>
                <li>Be inclusive</li>
                <li>Respect culture and custom</li>
                <li>Consider your actions and act with integrity</li>
                <li>
                    Use good judgment and avoid even the appearance of improper
                    behaviour
                </li>
                <li>Follow the law</li>
                <li>Be accountable</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                If ever in doubt about a course of conduct, ask yourself: Is it
                ethical? Is it legal? Will it reflect well on me as well as
                ElixirConf? Would I want to read about it in the newspaper or on
                the web? If the answer is "No" to any of these questions, don't
                do it. We want to thank you for helping make this a welcoming,
                friendly event for all.

            <h2>Legal Details</h2>

            <p>
                Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender,
                sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
                race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate
                intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or
                recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
                inappropriate physical contact and unwelcome sexual attention.
                Speakers, attendees, exhibitors, sponsors and vendors are
                subject to the code of conduct. Speakers, sponsors and
                exhibitors should not use profane, vulgar or sexual images,
                activities, or other material. Talks should be appropriate for
                both a professional audience and a younger audience. Imagery and

                vulgar or sexual content. Participants asked to stop any
                harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately. If a
                participant engages in behaviour that violates this code of
                conduct, the conference organizers may take any action they deem
                appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from
                the conference with no refund.
