Your safety and the safety of others is of the utmost importance to us as organisers and The Hilton Warsaw.

Before attending ElixirConf EU 2021 all attendees must complete and sign this waiver form via Whova app or on paper on the conference day.

All attendees must present **one of the following**:
* A negative COVID test dated no more than 72 hours prior to the conference (both quick test and PCR test are accepted)
* Proof of vaccination (either in writing, on a card, or on the mObywatel app - QR code)
* Answer yes to all questions 3-7 in waiver form.

Do not attend if you or anyone you have been in contact with has shown any symptoms of COVID 72 hours prior. If you click “Yes” on any item on the waiver form, you will **not** be admitted to the event.

Anyone who cannot attend in person can receive a full refund by contacting us up-to **a month** before the conference or exchange the in-person ticket to a virtual one and receive the reimbursement of the difference in the tickets’ prices. If circumstances change and there is **a legitimate legal reason** you are unable to travel to attend the conference, we will happily refund you right up until the day of the conference.

**During the conference we will ensure that:**
* All attendees will have their temperature taken before admission
* We will limit how many attendees can be in one room following the guidelines from the Polish Health Authorities and the Hilton
* There will be 1 meter between attendees and a seat will be blocked or moved apart between each delegate.
* Attendees will be seated facing the same direction
* All attendees, speakers, crew and any additional staff need to wear a face mask inside the venue.
* Sanitizers will be available on all tables and by all entrances
* All doorknobs and all horizontal surfaces will be disinfected after each session
* All food and snacks will be served separately by the venue staff
* Water served bottled
* All rooms will be vented after each session
* Money back guarantee if we have to postpone the conference.
